$!If you have a job when you're a student you may need to pay Income Tax and National Insurance (NI).$!

##Tax and National Insurance

You have to pay Income Tax and National Insurance if you earn over a certain amount. This is known as the Personal Allowance and is £7,475 in the tax year 2011-12. 

You have to pay NI if you earn more than £139 a week.

##Term-time jobs

If you work for an employer in term-time then your Income Tax and National Insurance are usually taken automatically from your wages through Pay As You Earn (PAYE).

##Holiday jobs in the UK

If you're a full-time student with a holiday job you may get your wages without tax being deducted. To do this you need to fill in a [P38(S) form.](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/students/work_hols_while_student_8_1.htm "P38(S) form."){:rel="external"}

The following also needs to apply:

- you're a full-time student in the UK only working in the holidays
- you're returning to full-time education after the holiday
- your total income for the year is below the Personal Allowance

If you don't qualify for exemption you need to pay tax through PAYE. 

You still need to pay NI if you earn more than the threshold.

##Holiday jobs abroad

If you normally live and study in the UK but work abroad during the holidays you'll need to pay:

- UK tax on anything you earn above the Personal Allowance
- NI if you work for a UK employer

If you work for a foreign employer you don't need to pay NI in the UK but might have to pay contributions in the country you're working in. 

If you're taxed abroad and can't claim it back you'll probably be able to get this paid back in the UK - contact Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs (HMRC) for details.
