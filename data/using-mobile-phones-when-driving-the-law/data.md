Your case could also go to court and you could be [disqualified from driving or riding](/driving-disqualifications "disqualified from driving or riding") and get a maximum fine of £1,000. Drivers of buses or goods vehicles could get a maximum fine of £2,500.

##When you can use a phone in your vehicle

If you're the driver, you can only use your phone in a vehicle if you:

- need to call 999 or 112 in an emergency and it’s unsafe or impractical to stop

- are safely parked

##Using hands-free devices when driving

You can use hands-free phones, sat navs and 2-way radios when you’re driving or riding. But if the police think you're distracted and not in control of your vehicle you could still get stopped and penalised.
