If you have one of these:\r\n\r\ns1. Your landlord must usually give you ['notice to quit'](/private-renting-tenancy-agreements/your-landlord-wants-to-end-your-tenancy \"Your landlord wants to end your tenancy\") - they must do this in a certain way depending on your type of tenancy agreement and its terms.\r\ns2. If you don't leave by the date on the notice to quit, your landlord must send you a 'notice of intention to seek possession' - this tells you they'll apply to the court for a possession order if you don't leave.\r\ns3. They must then apply to the court for a possession order, which gives them the right to evict you and take possession of the property.\r\ns4. If the court gives your landlord a possession order and you still don't leave, your landlord must apply for a warrant for eviction - this means bailiffs can remove you from the property.\r\n\r\n\r\n### A fixed-term AST\r\n\r\nFixed-term tenancies run for a set amount of time. Your landlord must [give you notice](/private-renting-tenancy-agreements/your-landlord-wants-to-end-your-tenancy \"Your landlord wants to end your tenancy\") in a certain way if you're in a fixed-term tenancy.\r\n\r\nIf you refuse to leave after being given notice, they must follow the same steps as for a periodic tenancy, from step 2.\r\n\r\n## Rules for excluded tenancies or licenses\r\n\r\nIf you have an [excluded tenancy or licence](/private-renting-tenancy-agreements/tenancy-types \"Tenancy types\") (eg you live with your landlord), your landlord doesn\u2019t have to go to court to evict you. \r\n\r\nYour landlord only needs to give you 'reasonable notice' to quit. Reasonable notice usually means the length of the rental payment period - so if you pay rent weekly, you\u2019ll get 1 week\u2019s notice. The notice doesn't have to be in writing. \r\n\r\nThey can then change the locks on your rooms, even if you\u2019ve left your belongings there. However, they must give your belongings back to you. \r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t think you\u2019ve been given enough warning to leave, contact your [local council](http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?LGSL=108&LGIL=8&ServiceName=Find+out+about+help+from+the+council+for+private+tenants \"Council help for private tenants\"){:rel=\"external\"} for advice. Your council can take action if your landlord has evicted you illegally.\r\n\r\n## Rules for assured and regulated tenancies\r\n\r\nIf your tenancy started before 27 February 1997, you might have an assured or a regulated tenancy.

This is quicker than a normal eviction and doesn\u2019t usually need a court hearing. \r\n\r\nYour landlord can only do this if:\r\n\r\n- you have an assured shorthold tenancy or a statutory periodic tenancy\r\n- you have a written tenancy agreement\r\n- they've given you the required written notice (a minimum of 2 months) in the right form\r\n- they haven't asked you to leave before the end of a fixed-term tenancy\r\n\r\n^You can only stop accelerated possession if you can prove your landlord hasn't followed the rules listed above.^\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nIf your landlord applies to the court for accelerated possession, the court will send you a copy of the application. \r\n\r\nIf you want to challenge the application, you must do this within 14 days of receiving it. \r\n\r\nA judge will decide whether to:\r\n\r\n- issue a possession order, giving your landlord the right to evict you and take possession of the property (this is normally the case)\r\n- have a court hearing (this usually only happens if the paperwork isn\u2019t in order or you\u2019ve raised an important issue)\r\n\r\nEven if there\u2019s a hearing, the court can still decide to issue a possession order.\r\n\r\n### If the judge issues a possession order\r\nIf the judge makes a possession order, you\u2019ll normally have 14 or 28 days to leave the property. If this will cause you exceptional hardship, the judge may give you up to 42 days to leave. \r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t leave at this point, your landlord can use bailiffs to evict you.","slug":"accelerated-possession","title":"Accelerated possession"}},{"table":{"body":"## Before the hearing\r\nYou\u2019ll know your landlord is taking you to court to evict you because you\u2019ll be sent court papers, including:\r\n\r\n- copies of 'claim for possession' forms\r\n- a defence form\r\n- a date for your court hearing\r\n\r\nThe defence form is your chance to say why you have rent arrears and if you disagree with what your landlord put on the 'claim for possession' forms.

If the landlord wants to evict you, they\u2019ll have to restart the court process from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThere are different kinds of orders a judge can make:\r\n\r\n### Order for possession (or \u2018outright possession order\u2019)\r\nThis means you must leave the property before the date given in the order. \r\n\r\nThe date will be either 14 or 28 days after your court hearing. If you\u2019re in an exceptionally difficult situation, you may be able to convince the judge to delay this for up to 6 weeks.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t leave your home by the date given, your landlord can ask the court to evict you by asking for a \u2018warrant for possession\u2019. If the court gives a warrant, you\u2019ll be sent an eviction notice that gives a date when you must leave your home. \r\n\r\n### Suspended order for possession\r\nThis means if you make the payments, or obey the conditions, set out in the order, you can stay in your home. If you don\u2019t make the payments, your landlord can ask the court to evict you. \r\n\r\n### Money order\r\nThis means you have to pay the landlord the amount set out in the order. If you don\u2019t make the payments, action could be taken by the courts to recover the money, including:\r\n\r\n- deducting money from your wages or bank account\r\n- sending bailiffs to take away things you own\r\n\r\nIf you get into rent arrears after a money order has been made, your landlord can go to court again and ask for a possession order.\r\n\r\n### Possession orders with a money judgment\r\nA judge can add a money judgment to any of the possession orders. This means you owe a specific amount of money, usually made up of:\r\n\r\n- your rent arrears\r\n- court fees\r\n- your landlord\u2019s legal costs\r\n\r\nThe money judgment won\u2019t apply if you pay your arrears and the amount set out in a suspended possession order.\r\n\r\nHowever, the money judgment will apply if you don\u2019t pay the amount set out in the suspended possession order that\u2019s linked to the judgment.
