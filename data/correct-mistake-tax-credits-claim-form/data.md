##If you haven't got an award notice yet
If the [Tax Credit Office](/contact-the-tax-credit-office "Contact the Tax Credit Office") have not looked at your claim, they will take the new information into account when deciding if you get tax credits or not. 

You will then get a tax credits award notice as normal saying what you are entitled to.

##You've already got your award notice
If the changes to your claim mean you get more tax credits, these will be backdated for up to 3 months. This is usually from the date you told the Tax Credit Office about the mistake. 

If you should have been getting less in tax credits, you will need to repay the difference. This will be backdated to when you made the claim.  

##Taking reasonable care when completing your claim form
This means you:

- filled it in as fully and as accurately as you could - you must have believed that all the information you gave was true and correct to the best of your knowledge
- read any notes and guidance to help you fill in the form
- asked someone to help you fill in the form if you needed help

##If you gave wrong information on purpose
If you deliberately put wrong information on your claim form then you may:

- get too much tax credits and have to repay them
- have to pay interest on the extra amount
- have to pay a penalty of up to Â£3,000
