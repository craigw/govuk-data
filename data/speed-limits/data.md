$!You must not drive faster than the speed limit for the type of road and your type of vehicle.$!

^Unless you see signs showing otherwise, a limit of 30 miles per hour (mph) or 48 kilometres per hour (km/h) usually applies to all traffic on all roads with street lighting.^

##National speed limits

Goods vehicles (above 7.5 tonnes maximum laden weight) | 30 (48) | 40 (64) | 50 (80) | 60 (96)

###Vans and ‘car-derived’ vans

Most vans are under 7.5 tonnes laden (loaded) weight and must follow the speed limits for goods vehicles of the same weight.

‘Car-derived’ vans weigh no more than 2 tonnes when loaded and are based on car designs, for example:

- Ford Fiesta van
- Vauxhall Astra van
- Fiat Punto van
- Peugeot 207 van
- Renault Clio van

##Locally set speed limits

^Local councils can also set their own speed limits in certain areas, and these must be clearly signed.^

For example:

- 20 mph zone in a built-up area near a school
- 50 mph (rather than 60 mph) limit on a stretch of road with sharp bends
