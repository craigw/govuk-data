$!If you think someone's Crown Court sentence is too low, you can ask for it to be reviewed.$!

Only certain types of cases can be reviewed, eg:

- murder
- rape
- robbery
- child sex crimes and child cruelty
- some serious fraud
- some serious drug crimes

^Anyone can ask for a sentence to be reviewed - they don't have to be involved in the case.^

##How to complain

You must contact the Attorney General's Office within 28 days of the sentence being passed.

The case is reviewed and may be sent to the Court of Appeal.

##The Court of Appeal

The Court of Appeal may decide that the sentence:

- should stay the same
- is unreasonably low (called 'unduly lenient') and may increase it

^Even if a case is passed on to the Court of Appeal it may not change the sentence.^
