$!Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) work with police officers and share some, but not all of their powers.$!

A PCSO can, for example:

- give someone a fixed-penalty notice - eg for littering
- demand the name and address of someone being anti-social
- take alcohol off a person aged under 18

A PCSO can't arrest a person but they can contact a police officer to do it.

They must wear a uniform clearly marked ‘PCSO’.

^The power of PCSOs can differ between [police forces.](http://www.police.uk/ "Find your local police force"){:rel="external"}^

##Special constables

Special constables are volunteers and have the same powers as police officers.
