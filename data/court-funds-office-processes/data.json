The Court Funds Office will write to the child 1 month before their 18th birthday and explain how they can get their money.\r\n\r\n##Statements\r\n\r\nThe Court Funds Office sends out annual statements for special accounts at the end of April. \r\n\r\nAnother statement is issued in October for all accounts that:\r\n\r\n- have a balance of \u00a3100,000 or more and are being held for a child\r\n- are being being held for Court of Protection clients\r\n\r\nYou can ask for a statement at any time by contacting the Court Funds Office:\r\n\r\n$C\r\n**Court Funds Office**  \r\n[enquiries@courtfunds.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:enquiries@courtfunds.gsi.gov.uk \"enquiries@courtfunds.gsi.gov.uk\")\r\n$C\r\n\r\n##Investments\r\n\r\nThe Court Funds Office can make stock market investments in a range of companies using the Equity Tracker Index Fund (ETIF). \r\n\r\nThey will invest money if all of the following apply:\r\n\r\n- the money is being held on behalf of a child or someone unable to make decisions for themselves\r\n- the amount of money being held is \u00a310,000 or more\r\n- the money is likely to be held for 5 or more years\r\n\r\nThe amount of money invested is based on instructions from the Court of Protection, a deputy or an investment manager appointed by a deputy.\r\n\r\nIf any investments are sold for more than their original value, tax may also be payable.
