If you were getting help towards your mortgage interest payments before 5 January 2009, you will continue to get help up to the same limit on your mortgage or loan. This is usually up to \u00a3100,000.\r\n \r\n##Rules that apply to SMI from 5 January 2009##\r\n \r\nFrom 5 January 2009, if you were getting:\r\n\r\n- Income Support\r\n- income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance\r\n- income-related Employment and Support Allowance\r\n\r\nmost claims would get help with interest payments on mortgage or loans up to \u00a3200,000.\r\n \r\nFrom 5 January 2009, those getting SMI up to \u00a3200,000 can keep this higher limit if they move onto Pension Credit within 12 weeks of stopping their claim to:\r\n\r\n- [Income Support](/income-support \"Income Support\")\r\n- income-based [Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance](/jobseekers-allowance \"Jobseeker's Allowance\")\r\n- income-related [Employment and Support Allowance](/employment-support-allowance \"Employment and Support Allowance\")\r\n\r\n##How SMI is paid##\r\n\r\nSMI is normally paid direct to your mortgage lender 13 weeks after you've claimed benefit - this is known as a waiting period.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re getting [Pension Credit](/pension-credit \"Pension Credit\"), there\u2019s no waiting period before SMI is paid.\r\n\r\n##How SMI is calculated##\r\n\r\nThe standard interest rate used to calculate SMI is currently 3.63%.\r\n\r\n##What\u2019s not included## \r\n\r\nSMI can\u2019t help you pay:\r\n\r\n- the amount you borrowed - only the interest on your mortgage is paid\r\n- anything towards insurance policies you have \r\n- mortgage arrears\r\n\r\n##Time limits##\r\n\r\nA 2 year time limit for SMI applies to new claimants getting income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance. This was introduced from 5 January 2009.\r\n\r\nIf you've been getting SMI as part of your income-based [Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance](/jobseekers-allowance \"Jobseeker's Allowance\") claim for 2 years from 5 January 2009 or later, you will no longer receive help with your mortgage interest as long as you remain in receipt of benefit. This applies if you have been getting SMI continually or through linked benefit claims.\r\n\r\nIt's important that you talk to your lender about this change. Lenders are required to treat people fairly, and must consider what they can do to prevent borrowers losing their homes.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s no limit to how long you can get SMI if you\u2019re getting:\r\n\r\n- [Income Support](/income-support \"Income Support\")\r\n- income-related [Employment and Support Allowance](employment-support-allowance \"Employment and Support Allowance\") \r\n- [Pension Credit](/pension-credit \"Pension Credit\") \r\n\r\n*[SMI]: Support for Mortgage Interest","slug":"what-youll-get","title":"What you'll get"}},{"table":{"body":"[Contact Jobcentre Plus](http://los.direct.gov.uk/default.aspx?type=1&lang=en \"contact Jobcentre Plus\"){:rel=\"external\"} to check your eligibility for SMI and ask any questions about this help you may have:\r\n\r\n- [Income Support](/income-support \"Income Support\")\r\n- income-based [Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance](/jobseekers-allowance \"Jobseeker's Allowance\")\r\n- income-related [Employment and Support Allowance](/employment-support-allowance \"Employment and Support Allowance\")\r\n\r\n[Contact the Pension Service](http://pensions-service.direct.gov.uk/en/find-pension-centre/home.asp \"contact the Pension Service\"){:rel=\"external\"} to check your eligibility for SMI and ask any questions about this help you may have.\r\n\r\n*[SMI]: Support for Mortgage Interest","slug":"eligibility","title":"Eligibility"}},{"table":{"body":"[Contact Jobcentre Plus](http://los.direct.gov.uk/default.aspx?type=1&lang=en \"contact Jobcentre Plus\"){:rel=\"external\"} to claim the following benefits, check your eligibility for SMI and ask any questions about this help you may have:\r\n\r\n- [Income Support](/income-support \"Income Support\")\r\n- income-based [Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance](/jobseekers-allowance \"Jobseeker's Allowance\")\r\n- income-related [Employment and Support Allowance](/employment-support-allowance \"Employment and Support Allowance\")\r\n\r\n[Contact the Pension Service](http://pensions-service.direct.gov.uk/en/find-pension-centre/home.asp \"contact the Pension Service\"){:rel=\"external\"} to claim Pension Credit, check your eligibility for SMI and ask any questions about this help you may have.\r\n\r\n*[SMI]: Support for Mortgage Interest","slug":"how-to-claim","title":"How to claim"}},{"table":{"body":"##Further help##\r\n\r\n^If you can't meet your mortgage repayments, or you are worried you might fall behind -  talk to your lender first^\r\n\r\nYou can get further information about mortgage arrears or payment difficulties from the [National Homelessness Advice Service](http://www.nhas.org.uk/index.htm \"National Homelessness Advice Service\"){:rel=\"external\"} or the [Money Advice Service.](http://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk \"the Money Advice Service\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\nYou can also get independent advice from other organisations, eg [Citizens Advice Bureau.](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/cabdir.ihtml#txt_getadvice_header-Anchor-search \"Find your local Citizens Advice Bureau\"){:rel=\"external\"} \r\n\r\n*[SMI]: Support for Mortgage Interest","slug":"further-information","title":"Further information"}}],"type":"programme"}
