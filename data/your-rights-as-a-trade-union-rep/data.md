Examples of trade union duties you have the right to paid time off for are:

+ negotiating pay, terms and conditions
+ helping union members with disciplinary or grievance procedures including meetings to hear their cases
+ going with union members to meetings with their line manager to discuss flexible working requests and requests not to retire
+ discussing issues that affect union members like redundancies or the sale of the business

If you're a union learning rep, you have the right to paid time off to:

+ analyse the learning or training needs of union members
+ give information and advice about learning or training 
+ arrange or encourage learning or training
+ discuss your activities as a learning representative with your employer

##When you aren't entitled to paid time off##
You aren't allowed paid time off to attend union meetings or go to meetings with union officials. However, your employer will allow you unpaid time off for these activities. You aren't allowed any time off for industrial action. 

##What is reasonable time off?## 

There isn't a legal definition of reasonable time off but things that need to be taken into account are the: 

+ kind of work your business or organisation does
+ need to do your work
+ needs of your line manager and co-workers
+ importance of health and safety at work
+ amount of time you've already had off for trade union work

If you're a union representative you need to discuss with your employer and come to an agreement about reasonable time off.
