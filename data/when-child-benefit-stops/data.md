##Child Benefit payments have stopped unexpectedly
There are several reasons why your payments may have  stopped, including:

- the Child Benefit Office has written to you but you haven't  replied
- your child has turned 16 and you haven't told the Child Benefit  Office about their education or training plans
- you've changed your bank or address and you haven't told the  Child Benefit Office
- your child has gone into care
- your child now lives with someone else
