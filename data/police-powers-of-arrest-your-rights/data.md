$!The police need reasonable grounds to suspect you're involved in a crime to arrest you.$!

The police have powers to arrest you anywhere and at any time, including on the street, at home or at work.

The police don't need a warrant to enter a building or property if a serious or dangerous incident has taken place.

##The police arrest procedure

If you're arrested the police must:

- identify themselves as the police
- tell you that you're being arrested
- tell you what crime they think you've committed
- explain why it's necessary to arrest you
- explain to you that you’re not free to leave

If you're under 18 and you're being arrested at school, the headteacher must give their permission and be present when you are arrested. The police must also contact your parents, guardian or carer as soon as possible.

##Police powers to use reasonable force

If you try to escape or become violent, the police can use 'reasonable force', eg holding you down so you can’t run off. 

You can also be handcuffed.

The police have powers to search you when you’re arrested.
