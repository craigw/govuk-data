$!If you donâ€™t report a change in your circumstances on purpose, or are dishonest in order to receive benefit, you're treated as committing benefit fraud.$!

##What happens if you're suspected of benefit fraud##

You'll be contacted by the Department for Work and Pensions or your local authority. You may be visited by Fraud Investigation Officers (FIOs) or be asked to attend an interview to talk about your claim. 

Your benefit may be stopped while the matter is investigated. If this happens, you should get a letter telling you what will happen next.

##What happens after a benefit fraud investigation##

FIOs will gather facts about your case and decide whether to take further action. If there's evidence that you're committing benefit fraud, one or more of the following may happen:

- you may be taken to court
- you may be asked to pay a penalty instead of going to court 
- your benefit may be reduced or stopped
- you'll be asked to pay back the overpaid benefit
