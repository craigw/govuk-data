If you're terminally ill, it's very unlikely that you'll need to have a medical examination.\r\n\r\nA medical examination involves an interview and sometimes a physical examination with a healthcare professional who has completed specialised training in disability awareness.\r\n\r\nThe examination is not to diagnose or discuss treatment of your medical condition. It is to assess how your condition affects you. To do this, the healthcare professional may not need to carry out a physical examination.\r\n\r\n##Medical examinations when you are already getting DLA##\r\n\r\nIf you're already getting DLA, you may be asked to attend a medical examination as part of the Right Payment Programme.\r\n\r\nUnder the Right Payment Programme, any DLA award may be reviewed to make sure the person is receiving the right amount of benefit.\r\n\r\nYour current benefit award will only be changed if the review highlights a change in your current entitlement. If this happens, your award will be adjusted - this could be up or down. If there are no material changes, your award will remain the same as before.\r\n\r\n**Renewal claims and reviews**\r\n\r\nIf you've been awarded benefit for a fixed period, you'll have to make another claim to renew your benefit just before your entitlement ends. This is called a 'renewal claim'. Renewal claims are treated exactly the same as new claims, so you may be asked to attend a medical examination.\r\n\r\nIf your benefit award is for an indefinite period, you will not usually have to make a renewal claim. Indefinite awards can sometimes be reviewed and you may need to have another medical examination as part of the review.\r\n\r\n**Your rights at a medical examination**\r\n\r\nThe medical examination will usually take place where you live or at a Medical Examination Centre near where you live. You should be given 7 days notice of your examination, but you can ask for an earlier appointment if that suits you better.\r\n\r\nIf you miss your first examination appointment, you will be offered a second appointment. If you miss 2 appointments, or refuse to attend, your benefit claim may be turned down.\r\n\r\nYou have the right to:\r\n\r\n- have a friend, relative or support worker with you at the medical examination\r\n- ask for an interpreter\r\n- ask to be examined by a healthcare professional of the same gender as yourself\r\n\r\nYou need to let Medical Services know ahead of time if you want an interpreter or same-gender healthcare professional. They will try to find one for you, but this may not always be possible in some areas.\r\n\r\n##What the medical examination involves##\r\n\r\nIt's important to tell the healthcare professional if your condition fluctuates and whether this is a good or bad day for you. \r\n\r\nBefore your medical examination, it's a good idea to think about how your illness or disability affects your everyday life. You might like to think about:\r\n\r\n- how much help you need during the day and during the night\r\n- what problems you have with getting around\r\n- if you can do more on some days than others, what a typical day is like for you\r\n\r\n##Identification you need##\r\n\r\nThe healthcare professional will ask to see some identification before the examination starts, to make sure you're the person they've been asked to visit.\r\n\r\nYou can use your passport, if you have one. If you don't take your passport, you need to show 3 documents from this list:\r\n\r\n- birth certificate\r\n- driving licence (card with photo)\r\n- your life assurance policy\r\n- bank statements\r\n\r\n##What happens at the medical examination##\r\n\r\nAs a rough guide, you should allow about an hour for your examination. Sometimes medical examinations can be completed in much less time, especially if the healthcare professional is looking at only 1 specific issue.\r\n\r\n###Interview###\r\n\r\nThe healthcare professional will interview you about the kind of help you need and any problems you have getting around. It's important to give the healthcare professional as much detail as you can. If someone else is attending the medical examination to support you, the healthcare professional may ask for your consent to interview that person separately. The healthcare professional will write a statement to record what you said in the interview. This information will provide the decision-maker with a clearer picture of your needs.\r\n\r\n###Physical examination###\r\n\r\nThe healthcare professional may decide a physical examination would be helpful. They should always explain what is involved first and check that you're happy for the examination to go ahead. It's important to tell the healthcare professional if you feel any discomfort. They will not ask you to carry out any action that causes you discomfort.\r\n\r\nThe healthcare professional also writes a report about the examination and returns it to the decision-maker. This report is usually written after the examination and you will not normally see it before it is submitted to the decision-maker.\r\n\r\n##Healthcare professional's report##\r\n\r\nYou can request a copy of the healthcare professional's report from the office that is dealing with your claim. They will send it to you by post. \r\n\r\n*[DLA]: Disability Living Allowance","slug":"further-information","title":"Further information"}}],"type":"programme"}
