Work out the total value of the assets and gifts. You should use a professional valuer for anything that's worth more than \u00a3500.\r\ns2. Deduct any debts that the person owed.\r\ns3. Record your valuation - include any paperwork you used to get valuations.\r\ns4. Decide if [Inheritance Tax](/inheritance-tax \"Inheritance Tax\") is due and which forms you need to complete (this depends on where the person lived and if tax is due). \r\n\r\n^If the person's affairs are complicated, a solicitor can help you value the estate and sort out the tax.^\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","slug":"overview","title":"Overview"}},{"table":{"body":"Inheritance Tax may be due on some gifts made by a person who dies, but only if the total value of the estate is more than \u00a3325,000.\r\n\r\n##Gifts to include in the valuation\r\n\r\nThe valuation should include:\r\n\r\n- assets (including cash) given away in the 7 years before the death\r\n- assets given away at any time if the deceased person kept an interest in it (eg a house they gave away but lived in rent-free)\r\n- gifts into [trusts](/trusts-taxes \"trusts\") - though some Inheritance Tax may have been paid when they were made\r\n\r\n^Some gifts are tax-exempt and don't have to be included - the guide to [Inheritance Tax](/inheritance-tax \"Inheritance Tax\") has more information.^\r\n\r\n##Working out the value of the gifts\r\n\r\nMost of the time you use the value of the gift when it was made. \r\n\r\nHowever, if the person had any assets worth more combined than split, and they gave part of them away as a gift, there will be a loss of value from their estate. \r\n\r\nInheritance Tax applies to this loss of value.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nSue has 2 paintings valued at \u00a3100,000 together, but each is only worth \u00a330,000 separately. She gives 1 to her daughter 2 years before she dies:\r\n\r\n- this means her estate has suffered a loss of value - you include this in the total valuation for Inheritance Tax, not the value of the painting\r\n- the figure is \u00a370,000 - ie \u00a3100,000 minus the \u00a330,000 for the painting\r\n- \u00a370,000 is added to your valuation\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n##If the total value of gifts is more than the Inheritance Tax threshold\r\n\r\nTax is due on all gifts that bring the total above the threshold. Gifts always use up the threshold before any other assets the person leaves.\r\n\r\nTo work out which gifts you need to pay tax on, follow these steps:\r\n\r\ns1. List in date order (oldest first) all the gifts the person made in the last 7 years that aren't exempt.\r\ns2. Keep a running total of their values.\r\ns3. When the running total goes over the threshold, that gift - or the part of it taking the total over the threshold - and all gifts after it are subject to Inheritance Tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Taper relief\r\n\r\nInheritance Tax is due at 40% on anything over the threshold, but if the person died 3-7 years after making the gift, you can apply 'Taper Relief' to reduce the amount of Inheritance Tax payable.\r\n\r\nIt works like this:\r\n\r\n###Taper Relief reductions\r\n\r\nTime between date gift was made and date of death | Taper Relief reduction on tax due\r\n- | -\r\n3-4 years | 20%\r\n4-5 years | 40%\r\n5-6 years | 60%\r\n6-7 years | 80%\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nJoe made a gift of \u00a3350,000 on 15 January 2006. He died on 15 April 2009. The Inheritance Tax threshold for that year is \u00a3325,000.\r\n\r\nHere's how to work out the Inheritance Tax:\r\n\r\ns1. Take away the threshold from the value of the gift: \u00a3350,000 \u2212 \u00a3325,000 = \u00a325,000. So Inheritance Tax is due on \u00a325,000.\r\ns2. Work out the Inheritance Tax at the full rate of 40%: \u00a325,000 \u00d7 40% = \u00a310,000.\r\ns3. The gift was made within 3-4 years of death. So Taper Relief at 20% is allowed: \u00a310,000 \u00d7 20% = \u00a32,000.\r\ns4. Take away the Taper Relief from the full tax charge: \u00a310,000 \u2212 \u00a32,000 = \u00a38,000.\r\n\r\nIn this example, Taper Relief reduces the amount of tax payable from \u00a310,000 to \u00a38,000.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n","slug":"valuing-gifts","title":"Gifts"}},{"table":{"body":"If the person who died owned assets or property jointly with other people, you need to work out their share and add this to your valuation. \r\n\r\n##Ways of owning property and assets\r\n\r\nThere are different ways they could have owned property or assets:\r\n\r\n- as sole tenant - they owned them 100%\r\n- as joint tenants - they owned an equal share with one or more people and their share passes automatically to the other joint owners\r\n- as tenants in common - they owned them with one or more people but the shares weren't equal, and each tenant can give away their share however they want\r\n\r\n^In Scotland, joint tenants are called 'joint owners' and tenants in common are called 'common owners'. The assets are usually passed on in a will.^\r\n\r\n##Valuing shares in a jointly-owned house or land \r\n\r\nThe value depends on:\r\n\r\n- the size of the deceased's share\r\n- who the other owner is\r\n\r\nTo work out the value of the share you need to know the market value of the whole property.

This affects what's included in the beneficiary's estate when they die. There are 2 main types of trust you might have to deal with.\r\n\r\n###Bare trusts\r\n\r\nThis is where the beneficiary is entitled to the income and the assets in the trust. When they die, both are counted as part of their estate. \r\n\r\n###Interest in possession trusts\r\n\r\nThis is where the beneficiary is entitled only to the income from the trust. Only the income's counted as part of their estate. \r\n\r\n^Not all income from interest in possession trusts is counted as part of the estate for Inheritance Tax. The trustees will help you work out the value of a trust's income.^\r\n\r\n##If the deceased transferred assets into a trust before they died\r\n\r\nYou'll need to find out whether the person made any transfers in the 7 years before they died. If they did, and they paid 20% Inheritance Tax, you'll need to pay an extra 20% from the estate. \r\n\r\n^Even if no Inheritance Tax was due on the transfer, you still have to add its value to the person's estate when you're valuing it for Inheritance Tax purposes.^\r\n\r\n##If the trust is set up by a will\r\n\r\nSomeone might ask that some or all of their assets are put into a trust. This is called a 'will trust'. \r\n\r\nThe personal representative of the deceased person has to make sure that the trust is properly set up with all taxes paid, and the trustees make sure that Inheritance Tax is paid on any future transfers.\r\n\r\nDealing with trusts for Inheritance Tax can be complicated.

You can find their value by:\r\n\r\n- looking it up yourself - use the closing price on the day the person died (you can find this in the financial pages of the following day's newspapers - libraries have copies of old newspapers)\r\n-  using a professional valuer - if the person owned a lot of shares, you can [ask a stockbroker](http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/tools-and-services/find-a-broker/locate-a-broker-search.html \"ask a stockbroker\"){:rel=\"external\"} to do it for you\r\n\r\n^Work out the total value by multiplying the number of shares by the price per share.^\r\n\r\n###If the shares changed price over the day\r\n\r\nIf you're given a range of prices, follow the steps in the example below:\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nThe range is 1091p to 1101p and you have to find the total price for 1,000 shares.\r\n\r\ns1. Find the difference between the higher price and the lower price: 1101p - 1091p = 10p.\r\ns2. Work out a quarter of the difference between the 2 prices: 10p x 0.25 = 2.5p.\r\ns3. Add this to the lower price: 1091p + 2.5p = 1093.5p. This new price is called the 'quarter up price' and this is the one you use.\r\n\r\nSo the quarter up price is 1093.5p and the value of the 1,000 shares is \u00a310,935 (1,000 x 1093.5p).\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n###If there are dividends (bonuses)\r\n\r\nStocks and shares usually pay a bonus called a dividend to their shareholders once or twice a year. \r\n\r\nSometimes instead there's an increase in the value of the shares or the shareholder is entitled to more shares.\r\n\r\nIf a bonus was due when the person died, the shares will have a marking next to the price, like 'xd', 'xc', 'xr', or 'xe'. Next to this will be a price or percentage to include in your valuation. \r\n\r\nYou work out the bonus to include in the value of the estate by multiplying the number of shares by the bonus figure per share. \r\n\r\n\r\n###Interest payments\r\n\r\nSome stocks and shares calculate interest on a daily basis but only pay it once or twice a year. These will have 'im' or 'ik' next to the price. \r\n\r\nYou need to work out the value from the date the last payment was made until the date of death. This can be complicated - ask a professional valuer to help.\r\n\r\n##Unit trusts\r\n\r\nNewspapers don't show the value of these so you need to ask the fund manager. If you're given 2 prices, use the lower one.\r\n\r\n##Government stocks and bonds\r\n\r\nIf the deceased person held these, contact Computershare at the UK Debt Management Office to get a valuation:\r\n\r\n$A\r\n\r\nComputershare Investor Services PLC  \r\nPO Box 2411  \r\nThe Pavilions  \r\nBridgwater Road  \r\nBristol BS99 6WX  \r\n\r\n$A\r\n\r\n##Shares in ISAs\r\n\r\nIf the person had shares in an ISA (Individual Savings account), ask the fund manager for a valuation. Contact details should be on the deceased person's paperwork.
