$!You must check if you need building regulations approval before you start any building work - your builder will usually do this for you but as the owner of a building you may be held responsible.$!

You usually need building regulations approval if you: 

- put up a new building
- extend or alter a building
- install services or fittings in a building, eg washing and sanitary facilities, hot water cylinders, foul water and rainwater drainage, replacement windows and any fuel burning appliances 

^Building regulations approval is separate from [planning permission](/planning-permission "Planning permission") and you may need to get both.^ 

Sometimes your installer (eg of windows or boilers) can self-certify the work if they're registered with a [Competent Person Scheme.](http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/buildingregulations/competentpersonsschemes/ "Competent Person Schemes"){:rel="external"} Check with your installer. 

Apply for building regulations approval through [your local council](/apply-building-regulation-approval-from-council "Apply for building regulations approval") or a private [approved inspector.](http://approvedinspectors.org.uk/members-directory/ "Approved inspectors website"){:rel="external"}

%You need to follow the [safety and energy efficiency guidelines](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2214/introduction/made "Safety and energy efficiency guidelines in building regulations legislation"){:rel="external"} set out in the building regulations even if you donâ€™t need to get formal approval.%
