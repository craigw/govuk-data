##When you don’t need to pay the fee

You don’t need to pay the £7 fee if:

* the vehicle is [exempt from paying vehicle tax](/vehicle-exempt-from-car-tax "exempt from paying vehicle tax")

* the tax disc has been lost in the post

* the tax disc can't be read or the colour has faded

* the police are keeping the disc as evidence

* the vehicle has been stolen and recovered without the tax disc

* a V14 ‘Application for a refund of vehicle tax’ has been rejected by the DVLA - a copy of the reject letter needs to be sent with the V20 form

If DVLA records show that you’re the registered keeper and the vehicle is taxed, you'll be sent a duplicate tax disc immediately.

Otherwise your application will be kept until the vehicle record has been updated, and you may get a temporary duplicate tax disc. You’ll get a full duplicate tax disc when the records are updated.
