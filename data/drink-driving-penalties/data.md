##The High Risk Offenders Scheme

If you’re a ‘high risk offender’, your driving licence won’t be returned automatically at the end of a driving ban. You'll only get your licence back if you pass a medical examination.

You’re a high risk offender if you:

- were convicted of 2 drink driving offences within 10 years
- were driving when you were at 2.5 times or more the legal alcohol limit
- refused to give the police a sample of breath, blood or urine to test for alcohol

##Other problems you could face

A conviction for drink driving also means:

- your car insurance costs will increase significantly
- if you drive for work, your employer will see your conviction on your licence
- you may have trouble travelling to countries like the USA
