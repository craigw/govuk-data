You need to:\r\n\r\n- check each one, making sure that the details are correct for the tax year or award period shown\r\n- call the [Tax Credit Helpline](/contact-the-tax-credit-office \"Contact the Tax Credit Office\") if anything is wrong, missing or incomplete, or if there's anything you don't understand\r\n\r\nYou can use the checklist that came with your award notice to help you do this.\r\n\r\n##When you can expect your award notice\r\nYou normally get your award notice within 8 weeks of renewing or reporting a change of circumstances.

You can do this by:\r\n\r\n- contacting the Tax Credit Helpline\r\n- writing to the Tax Credit Office\r\n\r\nYou need to do this by 31 July if you want your claim to stop for the current tax year. If you don't contact the [Tax Credit Office](/contact-the-tax-credit-office \"Contact the Tax Credit Office\") before this date, your claim will carry on until the end of the current tax year. It then won't be renewed the following year.\r\n\r\n##What to consider before leaving tax credits\r\nIf you stop tax credits:\r\n\r\n- you would need to make a new claim if your circumstances changed, for example if your income dropped or you had a baby\r\n- any new claim would only be backdated by up to 3 months (this can be longer if you qualify for the Disability element of Working Tax Credit)\r\n\r\nIf you delay in making a new claim you could lose out on payments.\r\n\r\nStaying in tax credits means:\r\n\r\n- your claim will be renewed, even if you haven\u2019t been getting any payments\r\n- you won't need to make a new claim if your circumstances change, for example if your income drops\r\n- you may be able to get extra money for the whole tax year if your circumstances change or your income drops\r\n\r\n##If the Tax Credit Office does not renew your claim\r\nIf the Tax Credit Office has sent you a letter saying that they won\u2019t be renewing your claim, you need to:\r\n\r\n- decide whether you want to renew your claim or stop tax credits\r\n- contact the Tax Credit Helpline, or write to the Tax Credit Office, by the date shown in the letter if you want to renew\r\n\r\nYou should still contact the Tax Credit Helpline if your circumstances have changed since you last renewed. This is particularly important if one of the following applies:\r\n\r\n- your total income for the tax year was less than the previous tax year\r\n- you expect your total income to drop below \u00a342,000 for the whole of the tax year\r\n\r\nA drop in income means you could still qualify for some tax credits payments.\r\n\r\nA tax year runs from 6 April one year to 5 April the next.\r\n\r\n##You currently qualify for the Disability element of Working Tax Credit\r\nYou may currently qualify for the Disability element of Working Tax Credit, even if you don't actually get any tax credits payments. Your latest award notice will tell you what you qualify for.\r\n\r\nIf this applies to you and you want to stop tax credits, you need to know that you:\r\n\r\n- would need to make a new claim for tax credits if your circumstances change later on\r\n- may not qualify for the Disability element when you make the new claim - especially if there's a gap of 8 weeks or more between leaving tax credits and making a new claim\r\n\r\nIf you decide to renew your tax credits, you can still qualify for the Disability element - as long as your circumstances stay the same.\r\n","slug":"stopping-tax-credits","title":"Stopping tax credits"}}],"type":"guide"}
