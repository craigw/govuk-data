$! You can teach your child at home, full or part-time ('home schooling') - but tell the school and your local council if you're taking them out of school. $!

% As a parent, you must  make sure your child receives a full-time education from the age of 5 but you don't have to follow the [national curriculum.](/national-curriculum "National curriculum") %

##Telling the council

If you want to home school your child and they're of pre-school age, you don't have to tell the council. If they're already registered at a school, tell the school and the local council.

###If the council wants to check on your child's education

The council can make an 'informal enquiry' if you're educating your child at home, to make sure they're getting a suitable education. If the council thinks your child isn't receiving a suitable education, they might serve a [school attendance order.](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/56/part/VI/chapter/II/crossheading/school-attendance-orders "School attendance order"){:rel="external"}

^You can get help with home education from your [local council.](http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/Start.do?mode=1 "Contact your council"){:rel="external"}^

##Telling the school

If you're taking your child out of school, write to the head teacher. You can ask the school to teach your child part-time, but the school doesn't have to accept your request.
