Not everyone will be contacted at the same time. This process started in October 2010 and is expected to be completed in 2014.\r\n\r\n###Questionnaire###\r\n\r\nJobcentre Plus will send you a questionnaire to complete. This questionnaire will ask about how your long term health condition or disability affects your ability to complete everyday tasks.\r\n\r\nYou must complete this questionnaire with as much detail as possible and return it by the date requested. If you do not, your benefit claim may be affected.\r\n\r\nInclude with your questionnaire any medical reports or letters you have which you feel will help to explain your long term health condition or disability. Send the originals, they will be returned to you. If you can't send the originals, send photo-copies of the reports or letters.\r\n\r\n###Work Capability Assessment###\r\n\r\nThe information you give will be used to decide if you need to attend a face-to-face assessment. This is called Work Capability Assessment. This assessment will help find out:\r\n\r\n- what you're able to do\r\n- whether you might be capable of work\r\n\r\n%If you're asked to attend an assessment, you must go and take part fully. If you don't, your benefit claim may be affected.%\r\n\r\n##If the review finds that you're capable of working##\r\n\r\nIf the assessment finds that you're capable of working, Jobcentre Plus will call you.

There will be no break in the payments you get.\r\n\r\nDepending on how severe your disability or health condition is, you will be placed in one of two groups:\r\n\r\n- Work Related Activity Group\r\n- Support Group\r\n\r\n###Work Related Activity Group###\r\n\r\nIf you're placed in the Work Related Activity Group, you will get support to help you prepare for suitable work.\r\n\r\nYour benefit may be affected if you don't take part in the work-related support.\r\n\r\n###Support Group###\r\n\r\nIf you are severely disabled or have the most severe health conditions you will be placed in the Support Group. You will not be expected to look for work and will get the extra support you need.\r\n\r\nYou will not have to take up any work-related support unless you want to.\r\n\r\n##If your circumstances change##\r\n\r\nTell [Jobcentre Plus](http://los.direct.gov.uk/default.aspx?type=2&lang=en \"contact Jobcentre Plus\"){:rel=\"external\"} if your circumstances change.
