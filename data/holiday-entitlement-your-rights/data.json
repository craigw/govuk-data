This is your normal working week (5 days) multiplied by 5.6. Your employer can include bank or public holidays as part of your statutory leave. \r\n\r\n##If you work part-time\r\nIf you work part-time, you are still entitled to 5.6 of your normal working week in paid holiday.

You must take your leave during this time - for example it could be 1 January to 31 December.
