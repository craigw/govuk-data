$!The law doesn't say an age when you can leave a child on their own, but it's an offence to leave a child alone if it places them at risk.$!

Use your judgement on how mature your child is before you decide to leave them alone.

The [National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC)](http://www.nspcc.org.uk/help-and-advice/for-parents-and-carers/positive-parenting/leaving-children-home-alone/leaving-children-home-alone_wda72908.html "National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC)"){:rel="external"} says:

- children under 12 are rarely mature enough to be left alone for a long period of time
- children under 16 shouldn't be left alone overnight
- babies, toddlers and very young children should never be left alone

@The law says that parents can be prosecuted if they leave a child unsupervised ‘in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health’.@
