$!If someone dies there are a number of places you can look to see if it has been stored.$!

You should check:

- the person's paperwork at home
- with their solicitor
- with their bank
- companies that offer the storage of wills - you can search online
- the Principal Registry of the Family Division

^Solicitors, banks and will storage companies need proof of the death (the medical or death certificate) and proof that you're the executor named in the will.^
