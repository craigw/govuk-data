This is what you can earn each year before you pay tax. \r\n\r\nThere are also other allowances, and you're only taxed above a certain level - see the [Income Tax rates and allowances](/income-tax-rates \"Income Tax rates and allowances\") to find out more.\r\n\r\n^There's information about various [tax reliefs](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/incometax/intro-tax-allow.htm \"tax reliefs\"){:rel=\"external\"} that can reduce your tax bill on the HMRC website.^\r\n\r\n\r\n*[HMRC]: HM Revenue & Customs\r\n*[PAYE]: Pay As You Earn","slug":"overview","title":"Overview"}},{"table":{"body":"Your tax code is used for calculating how much tax to deduct from your pay or pension.

Income you've not paid tax on (eg untaxed interest or part-time earnings) and any taxable employment benefits are added up.\r\ns3. The income you've not paid tax on is taken away from your allowances. What's left is the tax-free income you're allowed in a tax year.\r\ns4. This amount is divided by 10 and added to the letter for your circumstances. \r\n\r\nIt's important to have the right tax code - you could end up paying too much or too little tax otherwise.
