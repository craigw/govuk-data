It will be as local as possible to where you live.\r\n\r\nWhen you're sent a \u2018jury summons\u2019, you must complete and return it within 7 days.\r\n\r\nOnce your jury service is confirmed, you must turn up on the agreed start date. If you don't, you could be fined \u00a31,000.\r\n\r\n^Jury service is unpaid but you can claim for food and drink, travel and loss of earnings.^\r\n\r\n##When you can't do jury service\r\n\r\nThere are some situations when you can\u2019t be on a jury - eg if you've been in prison in the last 10 years. These are listed in the summons.\r\n\r\n##How long jury service lasts##\r\n\r\nJury service usually lasts for up to 10 working days - but can be longer.\r\n\r\nMany trials last only 2 or 3 days, so you may be on a jury for another trial.","slug":"overview","title":"Overview"}},{"table":{"body":"Give a copy of the letter confirming your jury service to your employer. \r\n\r\nYour employer must let you have time off work - however, they can ask you to delay your jury service if your absence will have a serious effect on business.\r\n\r\n##Wages during jury service##\r\nYour employer doesn't have to pay you but you can [claim for loss of earnings](what-you-can-claim \"What you can claim for during jury service\") from the court.\r\n\r\nYour employer must fill out a Certificate of Loss of Earnings which you get with the letter confirming your jury service. You then send it as part of your claim for expenses once you've completed jury service.\r\n\r\n##Problems with your employer\r\n\r\nYou can complain to an [employment tribunal](/employment-tribunals \"Employment tribunals\") if you're unreasonably refused time off for jury service.\r\n\r\nIf you're sacked because you do jury service you may be able to claim unfair dismissal.
