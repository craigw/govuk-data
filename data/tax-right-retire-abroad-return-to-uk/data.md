##If you retire abroad

You need to [tell HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).](http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/contactus/search.ladv?sr=0&as=1&cs=ISO-8859-1&sc=hmrc&sf=&sm=0&nh=50&ha=34&tx0=49612&fl0=__dsid:&tx1=2037&raction=view "tell HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)"){:rel="external"} They'll work out:

- your UK residency status
- how much tax you have to pay in the UK
- whether you need to fill out a [Self Assessment Tax return](/file-your-self-assessment-tax-return "Self Assessment Tax return")
- whether you're owed a tax refund

They'll give you a form to get any tax refund you're owed.

##If you retire in the UK after living abroad

You need to [tell HMRC](http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/contactus/search.ladv?sr=0&as=1&cs=ISO-8859-1&sc=hmrc&sf=&sm=0&nh=50&ha=34&tx0=49612&fl0=__dsid:&tx1=2037&raction=view "tell HMRC"){:rel="external"} so they can make sure you pay the right tax. Things to do in advance are:

- tell HMRC when you're returning to the UK
- check if you owe tax in the other country before you leave

The UK has arrangements with other countries to make sure you don't pay tax twice. How much you pay depends on your residency status. HMRC has produced a guide to help you understand the rules.
