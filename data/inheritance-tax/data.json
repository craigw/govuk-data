You can see a list of [Inheritance Tax thresholds](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/iht-thresholds.htm \"Inheritance Tax thresholds\"){:rel=\"external\"} on the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) website.\r\n\r\n##Who pays Inheritance Tax\r\n\r\nUsually the executor or personal representative for the person who has died pays Inheritance Tax using the funds from the estate. \r\n\r\nTrustees are responsible for paying Inheritance Tax on [trusts](/trusts-taxes \"trusts\"), which are a way of looking after assets (money, investments, land or buildings) for people. The trustee is the person who looks after the trust.\r\n\r\nIf you've got an inheritance or a gift from someone who has died you only owe Inheritance Tax if their estate is more than \u00a3325,000 and:\r\n\r\n- it says in the will that you should pay Inheritance Tax\r\n- or the deceased's estate can't pay it\r\n\r\n##Working out if Inheritance Tax is due on an estate\r\n\r\nIf you're the executor of an estate you need to work out if you need to pay Inheritance Tax. \r\n\r\nTo see if it's due, you:\r\n\r\n- add up the value of everything in the estate (including gifts made before the person died)\r\n- take away any debts, like bills and funeral expenses\r\n\r\nThere's detailed information to help you if you're [valuing the estate of someone who's died](/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died \"valuing the estate of someone who's died\").\r\n\r\n##Deadline for paying Inheritance Tax\r\n\r\nYou usually have to pay Inheritance Tax within 6 months of the person dying - after this, you have to pay [interest](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/iht-interest-rates.htm \"interest\"){:rel=\"external\"}. \r\n\r\nThere's more information on [Inheritance Tax deadlines](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/inheritancetax/paying-iht/payment-deadlines.htm \"Inheritance Tax deadlines\"){:rel=\"external\"} on the HMRC website.\r\n\r\n^Even if no Inheritance Tax is due, you still have to complete a ['Return of estate information' form](http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/view.page?formid=3307&record=hBFaNANqIOw \"Return of estate information form\"){:rel=\"external\"} if you're applying for [probate](/wills-probate-inheritance/applying-for-a-grant-of-representation \"applying for probate\").

This includes any gifts you give while you're alive.\r\n\r\n##Charities\r\n\r\nGifts you make to charities, museums, universities and the National Trust are exempt - for more information, call the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) Charities Helpline:\r\n\r\n$C\r\n\r\n**Charities Helpline**  \r\n\r\n0845 302 0203\r\n\r\n$C\r\n\r\n#Gifts - the 7-year rule\r\n\r\nIf you live for 7 years after making a gift to someone, it's exempt from Inheritance Tax regardless of the value. This is called a 'potentially exempt transfer'.\r\n\r\n^[Income Tax](/income-tax \"Income Tax\") might be due if you give away a house.^\r\n\r\n##Annual exemption\r\n\r\nYou can give away up to \u00a33,000 a year - you can also carry over unused allowance from previous years. These gifts will be exempt from Inheritance Tax when you die.\r\n\r\n##Small gift exemption\r\n\r\nYou can make small gifts of up to \u00a3250 to as many people as you like (but you can't use this exemption with the \u00a33,000 annual exemption for the same person).\r\n\r\n##Wedding and civil partnership gifts\r\n\r\nThese are exempt, with certain rules:\r\n\r\n- parents of the couple can give them cash or gifts worth up to \u00a33,000\r\n- grandparents can each give up to \u00a32,500\r\n- anyone else can give up to \u00a31,000\r\n- you have to make the gift, or promise to make it, on or shortly before the date of the wedding or civil partnership ceremony\r\n\r\n##Business relief\r\n\r\nIf you own a business or share of a business you may be able to pass some of it on without paying tax.

If the timber is sold, Inheritance Tax is then due. \r\n\r\nThe woodland might also qualify for agricultural relief or business relief if it's part of a working farm or business.\r\n\r\n##Heritage relief\r\n\r\nIf you own something of historic or scientific interest, it could be exempt from Inheritance Tax. Examples include:\r\n\r\n- buildings of outstanding historic or architectural interest\r\n- objects with national scientific, historic or artistic interest\r\n\r\nThe assets have to be made available for the public to view - there's a [database of heritage assets](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/heritage/index.htm \"database of heritage assets\"){:rel=\"external\"} on the HMRC website.\r\n\r\nThe rules on heritage relief are complicated - contact the Inheritance Tax Helpline for advice:\r\n\r\n$C\r\n\r\n**Inheritance Tax Helpline**  \r\n0845 302 0900 \r\n\r\n$C\r\n\r\n*[HMRC]:HM Revenue & Customs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","slug":"inheritance-tax-exemptions","title":"Inheritance Tax exemptions"}},{"table":{"body":"You can give your home to your children - or someone else - at any time.

This could be:\r\n\r\n- sole tenancy - you own 100% of the home\r\n- joint tenancy - you own an equal share of the home with one or more people \r\n- tenants in common - you own the home with one or more people but each share doesn't have to be equal\r\n\r\nIf you and your spouse or civil partner are joint tenants and one of you dies, the other automatically gets their share of the house. \r\n\r\nIf you own a home as tenants in common, you can pass your portion on to your children when you die and divide the property up between them and your partner. This can reduce the size of the estate for tax purposes.\r\n\r\n*[HMRC]:HM Revenue & Customs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","slug":"inheritance-tax-planning-passing-on-property","title":"Inheritance Tax planning - passing on property"}},{"table":{"body":"If someone leaves everything to their spouse or civil partner when they die and the partner has their permanent home in the UK, it's exempt from Inheritance Tax.  \r\n\r\nThis means their Inheritance Tax threshold hasn't been used and can be transferred to their partner's estate when they die, even if they remarry.\r\n\r\nSo, they could have an Inheritance Tax threshold of up to \u00a3650,000 - twice the usual threshold.\r\n\r\n##How the transfer works\r\n\r\nThe transfer happens when the second partner dies and is done by their executor or personal representative.
