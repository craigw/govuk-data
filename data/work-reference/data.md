$!An employer doesn't usually have to give a work reference - but if they do, it must be fair and accurate. You may be able to challenge a reference you think is unfair or misleading.$!

Your previous employer must give you a reference if:

- there was a written agreement to do so
- you work in a regulated industry - like financial services

If they give a reference it:

- must be be fair and accurate - and can include details about your performance and whether you were sacked
- can be brief - eg your job title, salary and when you were employed

^Once you start working for a new employer you can ask to see a copy of a reference - you have no right to ask your previous employer.^

##If you get a bad reference

If you think you've been given an unfair or misleading reference, you may be able to claim damages in a court. Your previous employer must be able to back up their reference - eg, by supplying examples of warning letters.

You must be able to show that:

- it's misleading or inaccurate
- you 'suffered a loss' - eg a job offer was withdrawn

##Discrimination and unfair dismissal

You may also be able to claim damages from a court if:

- your employment contract says you must be given a reference, but you employer refuses to
- your employer sacks you because they've been asked to give you a reference while you're still working for them
