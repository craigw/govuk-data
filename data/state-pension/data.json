If you\u2019re an employee, in 2011-12, you need to earn \u00a35,304.\r\n\r\nYou may earn a NI qualifying year if you\u2019re self-employed and paying Class 2 NI contributions. You won\u2019t earn a NI qualifying year if you have a small earnings exemption certificate and aren\u2019t paying Class 2 NI contributions.\r\n\r\n##Parents and carers \r\nFrom 6 April 2010 you may be able to get NI credits. If you have enough NI credit then these become NI qualifying years and go towards your State Pension. You may be eligible for NI credits if you\u2019re:\r\n\r\n- a parent claiming Child Benefit for a child under 12\r\n- an approved foster carer \r\n- caring for at least 20 hours per week for one or more severely disabled people\r\n\r\nBefore 6 April 2010, many people who cared for a child under 16 or someone who was severely disabled were eligible for Home Responsibilities Protection (HRP). HRP helped protect a person's State Pension entitlement in these circumstances.  \r\n\r\nNI credits for parents and carers replaced HRP from 6 April 2010. If you reach State Pension age on or after 6 April 2010 and you built up HRP before 6 April 2010 and you had years of HRP before 6 April 2010 these years have automatically been converted into NI credits. This is up to a maximum of 22 years. These NI credits will count towards your basic State Pension.\r\n\r\n##Claiming benefits\r\n\r\nYou'll automatically receive NI credits for the weeks you\u2019ve been claiming the following benefits:\r\n\r\n- Carer\u2019s Allowance  \r\n- Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance  \r\n- Incapacity Benefit  \r\n- Employment and Support Allowance\r\n\r\nFind out more about [getting credits towards your State Pension.](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Pensionsandretirementplanning/StatePension/DG_183760 \"Getting credits towards your State Pension\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\n##Your NI qualifying years\r\nYou can get an [estimate of how many NI qualifying years](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Pensionsandretirementplanning/StatePension/StatePensionforecast/DG_10014008 \"State Pension forecast\"){:rel=\"external\"} you may become entitled to based on your NI contributions to date.\r\n\r\n##How many qualifying years do you need?\r\nThe number of qualifying years you need for a full basic State Pension depends on your age and if you're a man or a woman.\r\n\r\n|**When you were born** | **Number of qualifying years you usually need** |\r\n| Men born before 6 April 1945 | 44 years |  \r\n| Men born on or after 6 April 1945 | 30 years | \r\n| Women born before 6 April 1950 | 39 years |  \r\n| Women born on or after 6 April 1950 | 30 years |  \r\n\r\n##If you don\u2019t qualify for a full basic State Pension\r\n\r\n###If you reached State Pension age on or after 6 April 2010\r\n\r\nIf you have some qualifying years but not enough for a full basic State Pension, then you may still get some basic State Pension.
