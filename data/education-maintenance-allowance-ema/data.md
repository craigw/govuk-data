## 16-19 Bursary Fund

If you are studying full-time or you are in training, you may get a [16-19 Bursary Fund](/1619-bursary-fund "16-19 Bursary Fund").

Bursaries are like grants and don't have to be paid back. You get your bursary directly from your school, college or training provider. 

You can't get EMA as well as a bursary - if you're eligible for a bursary your EMA payments will stop.
