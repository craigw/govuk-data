Work out the number of weeks from 1 October to the day before you start your holiday.   \r\ns2. Work out the number of qualifying days in that time.  \r\ns3. Divide the number of qualifying days by the number of weeks in step 1 - this gives you\u00a0the number of days you worked each week.  \r\ns4.
