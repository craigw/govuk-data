$!Default retirement age is being phased out - most people can now work for as long as they want to.$!

Some employers can set a compulsory retirement age if they have a good reason that they can clearly justify for their particular circumstances.

If you're unhappy with your employer's decision, you can challenge this at an [Employment Tribunal](/employment-tribunals "employment tribunal").

##If you've been told to retire at 65

Your employer can only use the default retirement age of 65 if:

- they formally told you this before 6 April 2011
- they gave you 6 to 12 months' notice
- you were aged 65 or above before 1 October 2011

^Retirement age is when you choose to retire - it's not the same as State Pension age (the earliest age you can get your State Pension). You can carry on working after you reach State Pension age.^
