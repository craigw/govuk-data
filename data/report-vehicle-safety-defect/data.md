$!If you think your vehicle or related part has a serious safety defect you can report this to the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA).$!

You can submit a report form online or print one out and send to the address on the form. VOSA will look into the problem and decide if the manufacturer needs to do anything or if the vehicle needs to be recalled.

##Before reporting a safety defect

Before reporting a safety defect you should make sure the problem with your vehicle is a ‘serious safety defect’.

VOSA defines this as a ‘feature of design or construction liable to cause a significant risk of personal injury or death’.

Things that aren’t serious safety defects include:

* defects that can be identified during routine maintenance/servicing and not repaired
* defects that give prior warning from warning lights, marked changes in handling and unusual noises

###Vehicles that are already recalled

The fault with your vehicle may be known by the manufacturer and the vehicle already recalled.

[Search the vehicle recall database](http://www.vosa.gov.uk/vosa/apps/recalls/default.asp "Search the vehicle recall database"){:rel="external"} to check.

You’ll need to know your:

- vehicle manufacturer
- vehicle model
- date of manufacture
