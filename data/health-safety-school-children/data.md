Schools are responsible for day-to-day health and safety whenever your child is in the care of school staff - this includes school trips and clubs.

##What schools are responsible for

Every school has a health and safety policy. Ask the school if you want to read it. It should contain details of what the school is responsible for, eg school trips, bullying and discipline, as well as what they should do to look after your child.

##If something goes wrong

If there's an accident or incident and you want advice about health and safety, [contact the HSE](http://www.hse.gov.uk/ "Contact the HSE"){:rel="external"}.

Who decides the health and safety policy and has ultimate responsibility for the health and safety of your child at school depends on the [type of school.](/types-of-school "Types of school")

If there's a serious accident, an outbreak of disease or a dangerous incident, the school must report this to the [Health and Safety Executive](http://www.hse.gov.uk/contact/index.htm "Health and Safety Executive"){:rel="external"} (HSE). If you want to check that the school has done this, contact the HSE.
