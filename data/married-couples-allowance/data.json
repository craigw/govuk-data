and the amount - depends on:\r\n\r\n- the date you married - or entered into a civil partnership\r\n- the age of the older partner - one of you must be **born before 6 April 1935**\r\n- your income\r\n\r\n##If you married before 5 December 2005\r\nThe husband gets the MCA - the amount depends on their income and the age of the older partner.\r\n\r\n##If you married on or after 5 December 2005 or are in a civil partnership\r\nThe person with the higher income can claim MCA - the amount depends on the age of the older partner and the income of the partner with the higher income.\r\n\r\n*[MCA]: Married Couple's Allowance","slug":"overview","title":"Overview"}},{"table":{"body":"For 2011/12, the minimum amount of MCA is \u00a32,800 and the maximum amount is \u00a37,295.\r\n\r\nYou get 10% of the allowance amount - so your tax bill could be reduced by at least \u00a3280 and up to \u00a3729.50.\r\n\r\n##How MCA is worked out\r\nTo work out MCA you need to know your income and what your [Personal Allowance](/income-tax-rates \"Income Tax Personal Allowance\") is - this is the amount of income you're allowed before you have to pay Income Tax.\r\n\r\n- the basic Personal Allowance for 2011/12 is \u00a37,475\r\n- the age-related Personal Allowance for someone aged 75 and over is \u00a310,090\r\n- for [Income Tax](/income-tax \"Income Tax\") purposes, your income includes pensions (State, company and personal), rental income and interest on savings or shares before tax has been taken off\r\n\r\n##Income limit\r\nBased on a full year's eligibility, you get the maximum amount if your income isn't more than \u00a324,000 - the 'income limit'.\r\n\r\nIf your income is over \u00a324,000 (before any allowances) your MCA is reduced in the same way that your age-related [Personal Allowance](/income-tax-rates \"Income Tax Personal Allowance\") can be reduced.\r\n\r\nThe reduction is worked out like this:\r\n\r\n- half your income that's over the limit for the age-related Personal Allowance is deducted until the basic Personal Allowance is reached\r\n- anything that's left is taken off the MCA until the minimum amount is reached\r\n\r\nIf your income doesn't reduce the age-related Personal Allowance to the basic level, your MCA isn't reduced.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n**Example**  \r\nYou're 77 and have an income (before allowances) of \u00a329,600    \r\nThe income limit is subtracted from your income (\u00a329,600 - \u00a324,000)  \r\nThis shows you're \u00a35,600 over the limit - half of this (\u00a32,800) is taken off your MCA  \r\n\r\nThis \u00a32,800 is taken off your MCA as follows:  \r\n  \r\nYour age-related Personal Allowance is reduced to the basic Personal Allowance level (\u00a310,090 - \u00a37,475 = \u00a32,615)    \r\nHalf of the amount you're over the income limit (\u00a32,800) is subtracted by \u00a32,615 = \u00a3185    \r\nThis is subtracted from the MCA amount (\u00a37,295 - \u00a3185) leaving \u00a37,110    \r\nYou MCA is 10% of this = \u00a3711.00    \r\n\r\nYour tax bill is reduced by this amount.    \r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*[MCA]: Married Couple's Allowance","slug":"what-youll-get","title":"What you'll get"}},{"table":{"body":"You can claim Married Couple's Allowance (MCA) if:\r\n\r\n- you're married or in a civil partnership \r\n- you're a taxpayer\r\n- you or your spouse or civil partner were **born before 6 April 1935**\r\n\r\n##The date you marry or enter into a civil partnership\r\nYou get MCA for each tax year that you're living together.\r\n\r\nIf you marry (or enter into a civil partnership) during the tax year (eg halfway through), your allowance will be based on the month it takes place.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n**Example**   \r\nIf you get married on 24 March, you would only get a twelfth, or 1 month's worth, of the allowance for that tax year, which begins 6 April.\r\n$E\r\n\r\nIf one of you dies, or if you divorce or separate, the MCA continues until the end of that tax year.\r\n\r\n*[MCA]: Married Couple's Allowance","slug":"eligibility","title":"Eligibility"}},{"table":{"body":"Contact HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) to claim.\r\n\r\nYou must give details of your:\r\n\r\n- marriage or civil partnership ceremony\r\n- spouse or civil partner -
