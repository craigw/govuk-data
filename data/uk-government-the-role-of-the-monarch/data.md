$! The monarch has a say in things like appointing the prime minister and dissolving parliament, though this is rarely used and is mostly symbolic. $!

The UK is a 'parliamentary democracy' with a 'constitutional monarch'. 

This means:

- a king or queen is the head of state
- a prime minister is the head of government
- people vote in elections for [MPs](/parliament-mps "MPs") to represent them in Parliament

^The current monarch is Queen Elizabeth II.^

The monarch in the UK doesn't make decisions about running the country - that's left to Parliament. The king or queen does however perform a range of symbolic duties, including:

- giving royal assent to legislation passed by the UK Parliament, the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly
- summoning and dissolving Parliament
- formally appointing people - including the prime minister and other government ministers, judges, officers in the armed forces, governors, diplomats, bishops and some other senior clergy of the Church of England
- granting peerages, knighthoods and other [honours](/honours-system "The honours system")
- pardoning people wrongly convicted of crimes
- declaring and ending war
- recognising foreign states
- taking over or giving up territory
