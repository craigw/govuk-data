$!The age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is 10 years old.$!

This means that children under 10 can't be arrested or charged with a crime.

However, children under 10 that break the law regularly can sometimes be taken into care, or their parents can be taken to court.

##Children over 10

Children between 10 and 17 can be arrested and taken to court if they commit a crime. 

They are treated differently from adults and are:

- dealt with by youth courts
- given different sentences
- sent to special secure centres for young people, not adult prisons

##Young people aged 18

Young people aged 18 are treated as an adult by the law.

If they're sent to prison, they'll be sent to a place that holds 18 to 25-year-olds, not a full adult prison.
