Once you've accepted an 'unconditional' job offer, you're in a legal contract of employment; your employer can withdraw a 'conditional' job offer if you don't meet their conditions (eg satisfactory references and health record).

%A job offer doesn't have to be in writing, nor does your acceptance - but it's a good idea to ask for and give something in writing.%

If you can, wait until you get your unconditional offer before handing in your notice as a conditional offer could fall through.

If your employer withdraws their job offer you can only take action if:

- you've accepted an unconditional job offer - you could sue for 'breach of contract'
- you have evidence you were discriminated against when your offer was withdrawn - you could go to an [employment tribunal](/employment-tribunals "employment tribunals")

If you've accepted an unconditional offer and you change your mind, ask your new employer to let you go. They may make you work your notice, or sue you for breach of contract.
