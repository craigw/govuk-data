$!You may have to go through a criminal records check if you're applying for some jobs - you'll have to fill in a paper application form.$!

You can’t apply for a criminal record check on yourself - this has to be done by the employer, or another organisation registered with the CRB.

When you apply, you need to provide documents to prove your name, date of birth and address, eg:

- your passport
- your driving licence
- a recent Council Tax bill

See the [full list of documents you can use for a CRB check.](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Startinganewjob/DG_195811 "full list of documents you can use for a CRB check"){:rel="external"}

##Types of CRB checks

There are 2 types of checks:

| Type of check | What it will show | How long it normally takes
|- | - | -
| Standard | spent and unspent convictions, cautions, reprimands, final warnings | about 2 weeks
| Enhanced | extra information, eg from local police records and Independent Safeguarding Authority | about 4 weeks

^You'll have to go through an enhanced check if you're applying to work with children or vulnerable people.^

You, and the employer, will see the results of your search.
