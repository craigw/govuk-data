##Hunting with dogs
You can't hunt some animals, like foxes, hares and deer, but you can hunt under certain conditions, for example: 

+ stalking and flushing out - but only to control pests and only if they're shot as soon as possible afterwards
+ hunting rats and rabbits
+ retrieving hares that have been shot
+ rescuing wounded animals, as long as they weren’t wounded on purpose
