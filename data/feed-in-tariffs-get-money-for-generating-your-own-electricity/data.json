This is called a 'Feed-in Tariff'. \r\n\r\n##How the tariffs work\r\n\r\nYou'll get a set amount for each unit (kilowatt hour) of electricity you generate. The rates vary depending on:\r\n\r\n- the size of your system\r\n- what technology you install\r\n- when your technology was installed\r\n- who put the technology in place - you need to use a [certified installer](http://www.microgenerationcertification.org/installers \"certified installer\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\nContact your electricity supplier for more information.\r\n\r\n##The export tariff - selling surplus energy \r\n\r\nIf you produce more energy than you use, you can sell it back to your electricity supplier. This is called an 'export tariff'. \r\n\r\nYour supplier will pay you 3.1p for every unit of spare electricity, and this money is on top of the Feed-in Tariff - ask your supplier for more information. You can use the calculators below to estimate how much you could earn.\r\n\r\n##How much you could get\r\n\r\nThe Energy Saving Trust has online calculators that help you estimate how much you could earn using the Feed-in Tariff scheme and selling surplus energy back. \r\n\r\nUse the:\r\n\r\n- [solar energy calculator](http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generate-your-own-energy/Solar-panels-PV/Solar-Energy-Calculator \"solar energy calculator\"){:rel=\"external\"} if you have solar panels\r\n- or the [cashback calculator](http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generate-your-own-energy/Financial-incentives/Cashback-Calculator \"cashback calculator\"){:rel=\"external\"} if you have wind turbines, hydroelectricity or micro combined heat and power systems\r\n\r\nThe Feed-in Tariff is currently [under review](feedin-tariff-review \"under review\") and the rates are changing - the calculators take this into account.\r\n\r\n","slug":"overview","title":"Overview"}},{"table":{"body":"Although the Feed-in Tariffs are [under review](feedin-tariff-review \"under review\"), you can still apply.\r\n\r\nTo qualify, your installation must have a peak output of no more than 5 megawatts peak output.
