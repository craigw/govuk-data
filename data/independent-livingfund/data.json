Each payment you get covers the 4 weeks that have just gone. \r\n\r\nWhen your award is reviewed, the ILF checks the records you'll have been asked to keep showing how you spent the money.

You can use a care agency or employ your own personal assistant (PA) for tasks including:\r\n\r\n- toileting, bathing, washing and dressing\r\n- eating and drinking\r\n- cooking and shopping\r\n- laundry, cleaning and other household tasks\r\n- physical movement, eg walking and getting about\r\n\r\nIf you employ your own carer or PA the ILF can also pay:\r\n\r\n- National Insurance contributions\r\n- holiday pay\r\n- liability insurance\r\n\r\nThe ILF will also consider paying for things like the costs of advertising for a PA and health and safety training for your PA.\r\n\r\n###What you can't use the money for###\r\n\r\nYou can't use the money to pay for:\r\n\r\n- any care you get from a relative who lives with you\r\n- any care provided by social services\r\n- maintaining your home or adapting your home\r\n- gardening\r\n- bills\r\n- private hospitals, residential care or holidays\r\n- petrol, taxi fares and travel expenses\r\n- childcare\r\n\r\n##On-going support and reviews of ILF payments##\r\n\r\nAn independent assessor will visit you every 2 years to make sure you\u2019re still getting the right level of payments and you\u2019re keeping the right records.\r\n\r\nThe ILF will write to you when you are due for a visit to tell you which assessor will contact you and explain what will happen. Your social worker (if you have one) will need to be there when the assessor visits.\r\n\r\nThey will check that you're getting the right amount of care and look at the records you've been keeping. They will also ask you about the care you pay for, the money you have and the benefits you get.\r\n\r\n##If your care costs change##\r\n\r\nThe ILF will not normally be able to meet increases in the amount of care you need. When reviewing your ILF payments, the assessor will consider if the amount of money you currently receive is sufficient.\r\n\r\nIf your care arrangements change and you need more money to pay for your care, contact your [local authority](/apply-needs-assessment-social-services \"Apply for a needs assessment by social services\") and ask them to reassess your care needs. They may be able to offer you extra help.\r\n\r\nThe ILF will consider giving you more money if you need to pay for employer costs. Examples of these include:\r\n\r\n- Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks\r\n- health and safety training\r\n- National Insurance contributions\r\n- Statutory Sick Pay\r\n- Advertising for a PA\r\n\r\n##If you're unhappy about a decision or award##\r\n\r\nIf you're unhappy about a decision or award, you can ask the ILF to look again at the decision. This is called a \u2018decision review\u2019. If you\u2019re not happy after the review, you can make an official complaint.\r\n\r\n$C**Independent Living Fund Helpline**\r\n\r\n**Telephone:** 0845 601 8815 or 0115 9450 700    \r\n**Textphone:** 0845 601 8816\r\n\r\nMonday to Thursday, 9am to 4:30pm and Friday, 9am and 4pm  \r\n(closed Wednesdays, 10:30am to 11:30am)  \r\n\r\nEmail: <funds@ilf.org.uk>$C\r\n\r\n$A\r\nEquinox House\r\nIsland Business Quarter\r\nCity Link\r\nNottingham\r\nNG2 4LA\r\n$A\r\n\r\n##If your circumstances change##\r\n\r\nTell the ILF straight away if your circumstances change.
