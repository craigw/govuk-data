$!Anyone over the age of 10 can get an Anti-social Behaviour Order (ASBO)$!

You can get an ASBO if you have behaved 'anti-socially'. This means things like:

- drunken or threatening behaviour
- vandalism and graffiti
- playing loud music at night

Getting an ASBO means you won't be allowed to do certain things, like:

- going to a particular place, eg your local town centre
- spending time with people who are known as trouble-makers
- drinking in the street

If you get an ASBO it will last for at least 2 years. It could be reviewed if your behaviour improves.

If you donâ€™t obey the ASBO, you could be taken to court.
