The period of time you use varies if you're calculating your pay for a specific reason.\r\n\r\n###Redundancy\r\n\r\nTo work out your pay during time off for job-hunting if you're being made redundant, use the 12-week period leading up to the day you got your redundancy notice.\r\n\r\n###Notice pay\r\n\r\nIf you want to know what your notice pay should be, use the 12-weeks leading up to the first day of the notice period.\r\n\r\n###Paid annual leave\r\n\r\nWork this out using the 12 weeks leading up to your holiday.\r\n\r\n###Guarantee payments\r\n\r\nUse the 12 weeks leading up to when your payment is due. If you no longer work for that employer, use the last 12 weeks of your employment with them.\r\n\r\n^If you didn't get pay for work for all of the 12 weeks (eg if you got holiday pay), use the previous week in your calculation. So if you didn't get pay for 3 weeks during the 12-week period, use a 15-week period instead.^\r\n\r\n###Working out your weekly figure\r\n\r\nAdd up the total amount of pay for the period and divide it by 12 to get the weekly figure. You do this even if you've had to use a period of more than 12 weeks.\r\n\r\n^Bonuses can also be included - read the information on how to [work out your pay with bonuses](pay-calculations-if-you-work-shifts-or-get-bonuses \"work out your pay with bonuses\") for help.^\r\n\r\n##Overtime\r\n\r\nIf your contract says your employer has to pay you overtime, this can be included in your calculations as well. \r\n\r\nIf you're paid at a higher rate for work that could be done in normal hours, the higher rate of pay can't be included - only your normal rate. \r\n\r\n##Work done for a previous employer\r\n\r\nYou can include pay for work done for a previous employer if you're calculating your average weekly pay and you didn't have a gap in employment when you changed jobs.\r\n\r\n##If you don't have normal working hours\r\n\r\nIf you do shift or rota work, working out your weekly pay can be more complicated - read the advice on [calculations if you work shifts](pay-calculations-if-you-work-shifts-or-get-bonuses \"calculations if you work shifts\").\r\n\r\n##If you need help\r\n\r\nIf you're having trouble calculating a week's pay, contact [Acas (the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service)](http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1461 \"Acas (the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service)\"){:rel=\"external\"} or [Citizens Advice.](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/getadvice.htm#searchbox \"Citizens Advice\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\n*[Acas]:the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service \r\n\r\n","slug":"working-out-your-pay","title":"Working out your pay"}},{"table":{"body":"If your pay or working hours vary from week to week, the calculations for working out your weekly pay are more complicated.\r\n\r\n##If your pay varies\r\n\r\nPay can vary depending on the amount of work you do, because of:\r\n\r\n- bonuses\r\n- commission\r\n- 'piece-work' - where you're paid by the amount of work you do, rather than by the hour\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, to work out your weekly pay you need to work out your average hourly rate over a 12-week period. \r\n\r\nTo do this, work out your total pay for the 12 weeks first. You can include overtime and bonuses. There are special calculations for bonuses.\r\n\r\n##Quarterly bonuses\r\n\r\nIf you get a quarterly bonus you can include a proportion of it in your calculations. Here's what to do:\r\n\r\ns1. Divide the amount by 13 (the number of weeks in a quarter of a year).\r\ns2. Multiply this figure by 12 (the number of weeks your pay is averaged across). \r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nIf you get a quarterly bonus of \u00a3260:\r\n\r\n- divide \u00a3260 by 13 weeks = \u00a320\r\n- multiply \u00a320 by 12 weeks = \u00a3240\r\n\r\nYou can include a bonus of \u00a3240 as part of your 12-week total.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n##Annual bonuses\r\n\r\nIf you get an annual bonus here's what you need to do.\r\n\r\ns1. Divide the amount by 52 (the number of weeks in a year).\r\ns2. Multiply this by 12.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nIf you get an annual bonus of \u00a35,200:\r\n\r\n- divide \u00a35,200 by 52 weeks = \u00a3100 per week\r\n- multiply \u00a3100 by 12 weeks = \u00a31,200\r\n\r\nYou can include a bonus of \u00a31,200 as part of your 12-week total.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\nOnce you've worked out your total pay for the 12-week period, work out the average hourly rate by dividing the total by the number of hours you worked in the 12-week period. \r\n\r\nTo work out your weekly wage, multiply your hourly rate by the average number of hours you worked each week in the 12-week period.\r\n\r\n##If you do shift or rota work\r\n\r\nYour week\u2019s pay will be the average number of hours you work at an average pay rate over a 12-week period.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nYour pay is \u00a36 per hour and you work 3, 9-hour shifts, then you have 3 days off. \r\n\r\nOn weekends you're paid \u00a39 per hour. At the start of the 12-week period, your first day at work is a Monday. Here's how you work out your pay.\r\n\r\ns1. Work out how many hours you did over the 12-week period (42, 9-hour shifts = 378 hours).\r\ns2. Divide this by 12 to work out your average weekly hours: 378 divided by 12 = 31.5 hours.\r\ns3. Calculate your pay for the weekday shifts. You'd have worked 30 weekday 9-hour shifts at \u00a36 per hour. 30 shifts x 9 hours = 270 hours. Multiply this by \u00a36 to get the total you were paid for your weekday shifts: \u00a31620. \r\ns4. Divide \u00a31620 by 12 to get the weekly figure: \u00a3135.\r\ns5. Calculate your pay for weekends. You'd have worked 12 weekend 9-hour shifts at \u00a39 per hour. 12 shifts x 9 hours = 108 hours. Multiply this by \u00a39 to get the weekend total: \u00a3972 \r\ns6. Divide this by 12 to get the weekly figure: \u00a381 per week.\r\ns7. Add the weekday and weekend figures together: \u00a3135 + \u00a381 = \u00a3216.
