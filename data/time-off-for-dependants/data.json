Check your contract, company handbook or intranet site to see if there are rules about this.\r\n\r\n##When you don't have the right to time off##\r\nYou can't have time off if you knew about a situation beforehand. For example you wouldn't be covered if you wanted to take your child to hospital for an appointment. You might be able to get [parental leave](/parental-leave \"parental leave\") instead.\r\n\r\n##Compassionate leave##\r\nIf you aren't given time off for dependants, your employer may allow you 'compassionate leave' - this can be paid or unpaid leave for emergency situations.
