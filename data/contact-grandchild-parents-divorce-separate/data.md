$!You may be able to get a court order to get access to your grandchild, if a parent stops you seeing them.$!

It's best to try to informally reach an agreement with the parents first.

If that doesn't work you can ask the court for permission to apply for a court order.

To do this, you need to fill in the [C2 application form.](http://hmctscourtfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=78 "C2 application form"){:rel="external"}

You may have to pay a Â£200 [court fee](/court-fees-what-they-are/ "court fee").

%Going to court should be a last resort, as it can be expensive, take a lot of time and be disruptive for the child.%
