$!If you've got tinted vehicle windows, the front window must let at least 75% of light through and the front side windows 70%.$!

There are no rules for tinting the rear windscreen or rear passenger windows.

It is also illegal to sell a vehicle with heavily tinted front windows.

##Penalties for having wrongly tinted windows

The police or VOSA vehicle examiners use light measuring equipment to measure window tint.

If your front or front side windows are tinted too much you could get:

- a ‘prohibition notice’ stopping you using your vehicle on the road until you have the extra tint removed
- a penalty notice or court summons
