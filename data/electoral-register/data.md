The new electoral register (also known as the electoral roll) is published on 1 December each year.

You'll be sent an electoral registration form between July and November. The form should list all the people who'll be living at your address on 15 October and who are eligible to vote.

You need to:

- check your details are correct
- return the form even if there's no change or no one's eligible to vote at your address

The register is also updated monthly from December to mid-August. If you register or change your details during this time, your new details will be included in the next monthly update.

##Who can use your details?

The electoral register comes in 2 versions:

- the 'full register'  - used only for elections, preventing and detecting crime, and checking applications for loans or credit
- the 'edited register' - available for general sale and can be used by anyone for any purpose

Your name and address will automatically appear on the full register. You can choose to appear on the edited register when you register to vote.
