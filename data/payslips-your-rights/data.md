$!Your payslip must show your earnings before and after any deductions, explain any deductions and show how your wage is paid.$!

##Deductions
Your employer must explain any fixed deductions from your wage, eg trade union subscriptions. They must do this either on your payslip, or in a separate written statement. 

You must be sent this separate statement before your first payslip and your employer must update it annually.

##When you don't have a right to a payslip
You don't have the right to a payslip if you're:

- not an employee, eg contractors, freelancers or 'workers' - [check your employment status](/employment-status "Employment status") to see if you're an employee
- in the police service
- a merchant seaman
- master or crew member working in share fishing (paid by a share in the profits or gross earnings of a fishing vessel)
 
^ If you have a problem with your payslip you should try sorting it out informally with your employer. ^
