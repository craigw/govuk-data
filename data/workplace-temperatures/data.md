$!The law doesn't say a minimum or maximum temperature, but during working hours the temperature in all workplaces inside buildings must be reasonable.$!

Guidance says your workplace temperature should be a minimum of 16ºC (or 13ºC if you're doing physical work). 

There's no maximum temperature limit.

Your employer must stick to health and safety at work law, including:

- keeping the temperature at a comfortable level
- providing clean and fresh air

Talk to your employer if your workplace temperature isn't comfortable.
