If you ignore it and stay in the property, or the council or housing association isn't satisfied with your response, they may apply to the court for permission to evict you.\r\n\r\n##Rent arrears\r\nIf you're facing eviction over unpaid rent, before taking you to court the council or housing association must:\r\n\r\n+ try to talk to you about the arrears as early as possible\r\n+ give you detailed information about the arrears\r\n+ offer help, if you need it, to make a housing benefit claim\r\n+ agree to delay taking you to court if you make a reasonable offer to pay off your rent arrears\r\n\r\nThese steps are known as the [\u2018pre-action protocol\u2019.](http://www.justice.gov.uk/guidance/courts-and-tribunals/courts/procedure-rules/civil/contents/protocols/prot_rent.htm \"Ministry of Justice: Pre-action protocol for rent arrears\"){:rel=\"external\"} \r\n","slug":"written-notice","title":"Written notice"}},{"table":{"body":"Your council or housing association will need permission from a court to evict you.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll get papers confirming the date of the hearing.
