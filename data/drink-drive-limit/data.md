$!There are strict alcohol limits for drivers, but it is impossible to say exactly how many drinks this equals - it is different for each person.$!

The legal alcohol limit for drivers in the UK is:

- 35 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath
- 80 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood
- 107 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of urine

^It’s not possible to say how much alcohol you can drink and stay below the limit. There are strict [drink driving penalties](/drink-driving-penalties "drink driving penalties") if you are caught over the limit.^

The way alcohol affects you depends on:

- your weight, age, sex and metabolism (the rate your body uses energy)
- the type and amount of alcohol you’re drinking
- what you’ve eaten recently
- your stress levels at the time
