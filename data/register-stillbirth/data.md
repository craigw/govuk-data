$!A stillbirth should be registered at a register office within 42 days.$!

Sometimes a stillbirth can be registered after 42 days - the hospital or register office can explain when this can happen. 

You can search for a [register office](/register-offices "register office").

^The baby can be named in the register.^

##Who can register the stillbirth

- **If the baby’s parents are married** - either the mother or father

- **If the baby’s parents aren't married** - if you both want the father’s name in the register, you can sign the register together

- **If the baby's parents aren't married and only the father registers the stillbirth** - a 'signed declaration' is needed from the mother; the register office can explain how to do this

- **If the baby's parents aren't married and only the mother registers the stillbirth** - the mother can sign and can choose not to record the father's name in the register - to include the father's details, a 'signed declaration' is needed from the father; the register office can explain how to do this

- **If the father can't be traced or is unknown** - the mother can sign

##What you need to take
You need the medical certificate of stillbirth issued by the doctor or midwife.
