$! If you find wreck material, like parts of a ship or its cargo, you have to report it to the Receiver of Wreck. $!

##What counts as wreck material

Wreck material includes things found on the sea shore or in tidal water that have come from a ship, aircraft or hovercraft (vessels). This could be parts of the vessel, its cargo or equipment.

There are 4 main categories:

- 'flotsam' - goods that have remained afloat after being lost from a ship that has sunk
- 'jetsam' - things that have been cast overboard from a ship that was in danger of sinking
- 'derelict' - property that has been abandoned at sea without hope of recovering it, which could be vessels or cargo
- 'lagan' - goods that have been buoyed (so they can be recovered) before being cast overboard from a ship that then sinks

Wreck material doesn't normally include:

- boats that have come off their moorings
- buoys, like marker or mooring buoys

It does include buoys that form part of fishing equipment.
