$!If you sell or transfer your vehicle you must tell DVLA straight away using the V5C registration certificate.$!

%You and the buyer should follow the procedures correctly or you could still be liable for the vehicle.%

##Telling DVLA if you have your V5C registration certificate

If you have a registration certificate:

s1. Complete section 6 on the V5C.
s2. Sign section 8 on the V5C.
s3. Get the buyer to also sign section 8 on the V5C.
s4. Send the V5C to **DVLA, Swansea, SA99 1BA**.
s5. Give the buyer the completed V5C/2 section.


### Selling to a motor trader

If you sell the vehicle to a motor trader you must:

s1. Complete the V5C/3 section.
s2. Get the details and signature of the motor trader.
s3. Post it to **DVLA, Swansea, SA99 1BD**.
s4. Give the V5C and uncompleted V5C/2 section to the trader.


%Don’t rely on anyone else to send the V5C/3 to DVLA.%

To see what counts as a 'motor trader' check the notes on the back of the V5C/3 certificate.

##If you don’t have your V5C registration certificate

If you don't have a V5C registration certificate write to **DVLA, Swansea, SA99 1AR** giving the:

- vehicle registration mark
- make and model
- exact date of sale
- name and address of the new keeper

%Make sure the new keeper sends DVLA a completed V62 form to apply for a new registration certificate. Otherwise the police could still contact you if they need to make enquiries about the vehicle.%

Once DVLA have updated their records you’ll get a letter within 4 weeks confirming that you're not liable for the vehicle any more.
