$!In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, 'devolved governments' have law-making powers in some areas.$!

Since devolution, some policies and services (eg education, health and transport) are different in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. 

The [Scottish Parliament](http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/ "Scottish Parliament website"){:rel="external"}, the [National Assembly for Wales](http://www.assemblywales.org/ "National Assembly for Wales website"){:rel="external"} and the [Northern Ireland Assembly](http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/ "Northern Ireland Assembly website"){:rel="external"}  have law-making powers on day-to-day issues.

They work alongside the [Scottish Government,](http://home.scotland.gov.uk/home "Scottish Government website"){:rel="external"} the [Welsh Assembly Government](http://new.wales.gov.uk/?lang=en "Welsh Assembly Government website"){:rel="external"} and the [Northern Ireland Executive.](http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/ "Northern Ireland Executive website"){:rel="external"}

The UK government is still responsible for national policy on things that aren't devolved, including:

- foreign affairs
- defence
- social security
- trade

^There is no devolved government for England.^
