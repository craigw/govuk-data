For example:\r\n\r\n- behavioural/social, eg difficulty making friends\r\n- reading and writing (eg dyslexia)\r\n- understanding things\r\n- concentrating (eg Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)\r\n- physical needs or impairments\r\n\r\n##Who to talk to if your child has special educational needs\r\n\r\nIf you think your child may have special educational needs, contact the person in your child's school or nursery responsible for special educational needs. This person is called the 'SEN coordinator', or 'SENCO'. If your child isn't in a school or nursery, contact the local council or your doctor.\r\n\r\n##Types of support\r\n\r\nThere are stages of support to try and help children with special education needs. If your child is getting the help they need and they're learning well, there's no need for them to go on to the next stage. If your child has high needs, they won't need to go through earlier stages of support and can get an assessment straight away.\r\n\r\ns1. Early Years Action/School Action.\r\ns2. Early Years Action Plus/School Action Plus.\r\ns3. Assessment.\r\ns4. Statement of special educational needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Early Years Action/School Action\r\n\r\nYour child's teachers or SENCO will discuss your child's needs with you and decide what help to give. You should be asked about the help your child is given and its results.\r\n\r\nThis could mean a different way of teaching certain things, or some help from an extra adult.\r\n\r\n###Early Years Action Plus/School Action Plus\r\n\r\nThis is extra help from an external specialist, eg a speech therapist.\r\n\r\n###Assessments\r\n\r\nAn [assessment of special educational needs](/children-with-special-educational-needs/assessments \"Assessments\") is carried out by the local council. Experts and people involved in your child's education will be asked about your child's needs and what should be done to meet them.\r\n\r\n###Statement\r\n\r\nA [statement of special educational needs](/children-with-special-educational-needs/statements \"Statements\") describes your child's needs and how they should be met, including what school they should go to.\r\n\r\n*[SENCO]: Special Educational Needs Coordinator\r\n*[SEN]: Special Educational Needs","slug":"overview","title":"Overview"}},{"table":{"body":"Either you or your child's nursery or school can [ask for an assessment](/apply-special-educational-needs-assessment \"Apply for an assessment of special educational needs\") from the council. The council will get back to you within 6 weeks to say if they'll do an assessment. If your child is under 2, the council can refuse. If the child is over 2, you can appeal.\r\n\r\nIf your child is over 2, there are rules and time limits for assessments. If your child is under 2, the council decides how to do it.\r\n\r\nThese people will be involved in an assessment:\r\n\r\n- you\r\n- your child's school/nursery\r\n- educational psychologist\r\n- doctor\r\n- social services (will only give advice if they know your child)\r\n- anyone else the council thinks it should ask\r\n\r\nYou can go to any interview or test that happens during the assessment. You can also suggest other people the council should talk to, eg voluntary organisations or charities.\r\n\r\nAfter an assessment you might get a ['statement of SEN'.](/children-with-special-educational-needs/statements \"Statements of special educational needs\")\r\n\r\n*[SENCO]: Special Educational Needs Coordinator\r\n*[SEN]: Special Educational Needs","slug":"assessments","title":"Assessments"}},{"table":{"body":"Statements of special educational needs are reviewed every year.

This can only be the same type of school, eg mainstream school or special school.\r\n\r\n##Appealing against a statement\r\n\r\nIf you disagree with a statement of special educational needs you can appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.\r\n\r\n\r\n$A\r\nFirst Tier Tribunal for Special Educational Needs and Disability  \r\n2nd Floor Old Hall  \r\nMowden Hall  \r\nStaindrop Road  \r\nDarlington  \r\nDL3 9BG\r\n$A\r\n\r\n$C\r\nTelephone: 08702 412 555  \r\n<sendistqueries@tribunals.gsi.gov.uk>\r\n$C","slug":"statements","title":"Statements"}}],"type":"guide"}
