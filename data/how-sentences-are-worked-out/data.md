$!If you are found guilty of a crime, your sentence will depend on a number of factors, including the type, seriousness and circumstances of the crime.$!

When deciding on a sentence, the judge or magistrate will consider things like:

- your age
- the seriousness of the crime
- if you have a criminal record
- if you pleaded guilty or not guilty

##Aggravating or mitigating circumstances

^Your sentence might depend on any 'aggravating' or 'mitigating' circumstances.^

An aggravating circumstance is something that makes a crime more serious, eg burgling someone's house while they are asleep in bed.

A mitigating circumstance is something that makes a crime less serious, eg you have problems in your personal life that have affected your behaviour.

##Sentencing guidelines

Judges and magistrates use guidelines from the Court of Appeal and [The Sentencing Council](http://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/ "The Sentencing Council"){:rel="external"} when deciding what sentences to give.
