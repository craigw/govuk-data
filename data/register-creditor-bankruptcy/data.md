If you're owed money in a bankruptcy or company liquidation case, use a Proof of Debt form to register as a creditor and make a claim for the money you're owed.

##Proof of Debt form

To make a claim you should complete a Proof of Debt form. 

If the official receiver (an officer of the bankruptcy court) holds a meeting of creditors to appoint an insolvency practitioner you should automatically be sent a proof of debt form to complete and return by a specified date. 

If you don't return the form by the specified date your claim will still be accepted but you won't be able to vote to appoint an insolvency practitioner.

###What happens next
The trustee or liquidator will send you a report about the debts and assets being used to pay the creditors. If there's any money available they'll tell you how much you'll get and explain why. If you want to dispute the amount, get legal advice.
