$!If you’ve got a UK biometric passport you can use its number for your driving licence application; otherwise you’ll need to send in an original identity document.$!

##UK biometric passports

If you have a biometric passport (where the photograph and signature are on the same page) you can just use the 9-digit passport number for your driving licence application.

You won’t need to send your passport in with your application.

##Other types of identification

If you don’t have a biometric passport other types of identity documents are also accepted. 

^You’ll need to send the original document with your driving licence application. Photocopies or laminated certificates are not accepted.^

You can send:

* a full valid current passport
* a biometric residence permit (formerly known as the identity card for foreign nationals)
* a UK certificate of naturalisation

^Don’t send in your passport if you need it within the next month - consider delaying your driving licence application until after you have travelled.^

###If you’re a pensioner

If you’ve reached State Pension age, you can also send an original of one of the following in your name:

* recent (within 3 months) bank or building society statement showing your pension payment and National Insurance number
* BR2102, BR2103 or BR5899 letter confirming your eligibility for the State Pension

###UK birth and adoption certificates

UK birth and adoption certificates can also be used, but need to be sent with one of the following:

* National Insurance card or a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions showing your National Insurance number
* photocopy of the front page of a benefits book or an original benefits claim letter
* P45, P60 or pay slip
* marriage certificate or divorce papers (decree nisi or absolute)
* college or university union card or school record

##If your name has changed

You’ll need to provide evidence if your name has changed since your identity document was issued.

The details you give must show a clear link between the name on your identity document and your current name.

##Getting your documents back

You’ll get your driving licence and identity documents separately. 

If you don’t get your identity documents back within 2 weeks of receiving your driving licence, call **DVLA Customer Enquiries** on **0300 790 6801**.

Include a stamped self-addressed special delivery envelope if you want your identity documents returned by special delivery.
