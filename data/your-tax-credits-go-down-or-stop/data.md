Your payments may have gone down or stopped because:

* your award notice shows you have been overpaid
* you haven't renewed your tax credits claim
* your income is too high to get tax credits from 6 April 2011
* you were getting the extra payment for having a baby under the age of 1, which stopped from 6 April 2011
* your income has gone up by more than Â£10,000, and so your tax credit payments have gone down

Your payments may also change if you haven't told the [Tax Credit Office](/contact-the-tax-credit-office "Contact the Tax Credit Office") that:

- your child is 16 but staying in full-time education or approved training
- you have changed your bank, building society or Post Office card account details
- you've not provided the Tax Credit Office with any bank account details
- you have changed address
