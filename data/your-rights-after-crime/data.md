While the police are investigating the crime, they'll give you an update on the case at least once a month until it's closed.

The police will let you know within 5 days if someone is:

- arrested

- released on bail
- given a caution, reprimand, final warning, or penalty notice

The police will tell you if they canâ€™t investigate the crime within 5 days of you reporting it. They will also tell you why they've dropped their investigation.

###Crown Prosecution Service (CPS)

When the police have finished their investigation, they'll pass the information to CPS who then decide if there's enough evidence to take the case to court. 

If the CPS decide to drop or alter the charge, they must tell you within 5 days.

##Victim personal statement

You can tell the police how the crime has affected you. This is called a 'victim personal statement'. It can be used later when the court is deciding on a punishment.

##Privacy

The police might give some information about the crime to the media to help with the investigation. They'll normally ask your permission before they do this.

If you've been the victim of a sexual assault or rape, it's against the law for anyone to publish your name, photo or anything else that could identify you.
