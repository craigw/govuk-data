$!The police can check if someone involved with a child has a record of sexual offences.$!

^You do not have to be a relative of the child you are concerned about.^

You have to [visit your local police station](http://www.police.uk "visit your local police station"){:rel="external"} to ask them to check someone's background.

At the police station, you will need to:

- show some ID, eg your passport or driving licence
- say why you want to have this particular person checked
- tell the police what your relationship to the child is

%Call 999 if you think the child is in immediate danger.%
