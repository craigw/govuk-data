Find out the new rate of vehicle tax.\r\ns2. Work out the difference between the old and new rates of your current tax disc. For example, if the old rate is \u00a3100 and the new rate is \u00a3130 the difference is \u00a330.\r\ns3. Divide the difference by the period of your current tax disc. For example, \u00a330 divided by 12 months is \u00a32.50.\r\ns4. Multiply this by the number of months left on the tax disc. For example, \u00a32.50 multiplied by 4 months is \u00a310.\r\ns5. In this case you\u2019ll need to pay \u00a310 extra tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n*[DVLA]: Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency","overview":"Apply at DVLA local offices or fill in form V70 \u2018Application to exchange a vehicle tax disc\u2019 and send to DVLA with any payment and extra documents","title":"Exchange a tax disc","type":"answer"}
