##When to exchange your tax disc

You need to exchange your tax disc if you make any changes to your vehicle that will change the tax class or the amount of vehicle tax you pay.

Exchange your tax disc if you change the:

- tax class (unless you are changing to a tax class exempt from vehicle tax)
- engine size (cc)
- fuel type
- weight of a goods vehicle
- number of seats on a bus
- use of the vehicle

##Documents you'll need for the application

The documents you need depends on the type of vehicle.

###Private or light goods vehicles

You'll need:

- form V70 ‘Exchange of Vehicle Licence Application Form’

- registration certificate (V5C) with any changes marked on it
- completed V62 [‘application for a vehicle registration certificate (V5C)’](/vehicle-registration-certificate-v5c-log-book "‘application for a vehicle registration certificate (V5C)’") (if you don’t have the V5C registration certificate)
- valid insurance certificate
- valid MOT test certificate (if needed)

##How to work out your extra vehicle tax payment

s1. Find out the new rate of vehicle tax.
s2. Work out the difference between the old and new rates of your current tax disc. For example, if the old rate is £100 and the new rate is £130 the difference is £30.
s3. Divide the difference by the period of your current tax disc. For example, £30 divided by 12 months is £2.50.
s4. Multiply this by the number of months left on the tax disc. For example, £2.50 multiplied by 4 months is £10.
s5. In this case you’ll need to pay £10 extra tax.
