$!Your council must help if you're legally homeless, but how much depends on your eligibility, your level of need and if your homelessness is your fault.$!

##Legally homeless
You may be legally homeless if:

- you’ve no legal right to live in accommodation anywhere in the world
- you can’t get into your home – eg your landlord has locked you out
- it’s not reasonable to stay in your home – eg risk of violence or abuse
- you’re forced to live apart from your family or who you normally live with because it's not suitable
- you’re living in very poor conditions - eg overcrowding

##Priority need
You’re in priority need if:

- you or someone you live with is pregnant
- ‘dependent children’ live with you (under 16s or under 19s if studying full-time)
- you’re ‘vulnerable‘ eg you would come to harm if left homeless
- you’re homeless after a flood, fire or other disaster

^You'll need to pay towards your housing costs - you could get [Housing Benefit](/housing-benefit "Housing Benefit").^
