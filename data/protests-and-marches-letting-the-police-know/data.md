$!By law you must tell the police in writing 6 days before a public march if you're the organiser$!

[Tell the police](http://www.police.uk/?view=force_sites "Find a police force"){:rel="external"} the:

- date and time of the march
- route
- expected number of people

The police have the power to:

- limit or change the route of your march
- ban it altogether

^If you arrange the march at short notice, you must still tell the police as soon as you can^

##If there's no march involved

If there's no march, you don't have to tell the police, but it's still a good idea. 

The police can change the location and limit how long a rally lasts. They can stop a sit-down protest if it blocks road traffic or public walkways.
