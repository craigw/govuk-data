You may also be automatically entitled to lower categories if you pass a higher category driving test.$!\r\n\r\n##Staging - adding higher category entitlements to your licence\r\n\r\nIf you have the right entitlement on your licence, you can then apply for provisional entitlement for a higher category of vehicle to be put on your licence. This is called 'staging'.\r\n\r\nFor example, you must have a full car licence before you can [apply for provisional entitlement to drive a lorry, minibus or bus.](/become-lorry-bus-driver/applying-for-a-bus-or-lorry-provisional-entitlement \"apply for provisional entitlement to drive a lorry, minibus or bus\").\r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve got the provisional entitlement you can take the test for the new category.\r\n\r\nThe table shows the full licence you need before you can apply for provisional entitlement in the higher categories.\r\n\r\nProvisional entitlement required | Full licence needed\r\n- | -\r\nB+E*, G*, H*, C1, C, D1, D | B\r\nC1+E | C1\r\nC+E | C\r\nD1+E | D1\r\nD+E | D\r\n\r\n*You automatically get provisional entitlement to these categories with a full B (car) licence.\r\n\r\n^The entitlements you have are shown on your licence. If your licence was issued before 1 January 1997 it may already include some higher categories.^\r\n\r\n##Upgrading - getting lower categories added automatically when you pass a driving test\r\n\r\nIf you pass the driving test for a larger vehicle category, sometimes you\u2019ll have lower categories upgraded automatically.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example:** If you have a licence with entitlements for vehicle categories B and C1 and then pass the C1+E test, you\u2019ll not only get entitlement to drive C1+E vehicles, but will also be automatically upgraded to drive B+E category vehicles.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\nUpgrading doesn\u2019t apply for trailer entitlements. If you get trailer entitlement for a larger vehicle you won\u2019t get the trailer entitlement for the smaller vehicles you\u2019d normally get through upgrading.\r\n\r\nAs a guideline:\r\n\r\n- lorry entitlements can upgrade bus entitlements\r\n- bus entitlements can\u2019t upgrade lorry entitlements\r\n- both lorry and bus entitlements can upgrade car entitlements\r\n\r\nThe table shows the original vehicle categories held, the higher vehicle category that\u2019s been passed and the vehicle categories that will be upgraded automatically.\r\n\r\nFull category held | New test passed | Upgrading\r\n- | - | -\r\nB, C1 | C1+E | B+E\r\nB, D1 | D1+E | B+E\r\nB, C1, D1 | C1+E | B+E, D1+E\r\nB, C1, D1 | D1+E | B+E\r\nB, C1, D1 | C+E | B+E, C1+E\r\nB, C1, C, D1, D | D+E | B+E, D1+E\r\nB, C1, C, D1, D | C+E | B+E, C1+E, D1+E, D+E\r\n\r\n##Further information:\r\n\r\nFor further information about staging or upgrading write to the DVLA Drivers Customer Services.\r\n\r\n$A\r\n\r\nDrivers Customer Services (DCS)\r\nCorrespondence Team\r\nD12\r\nDVLA\r\nSwansea\r\nSA6 7JL\r\n\r\n$A\r\n\r\n*[DVLA]: Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency","overview":"You may be able to get provisional entitlement to higher category vehicles, and automatic entitlement to lower categories if you pass a higher category driving test","title":"Adding higher categories to your driving licence","type":"answer"}
