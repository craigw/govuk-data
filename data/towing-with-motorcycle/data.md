$!You can use motorcycles with an engine size of 125cc or more to tow small trailers.$!

Your motorcycle has to be clearly and permanently marked with its 'kerbside weight'.

^Kerbside weight is the weight of the vehicle without passengers or any load but with a full tank of fuel and filled up with the necessary oils, water and fluids.^

The trailer must be no more than 1 metre wide and must be clearly and permanently marked with its unladen weight.

When the trailer is loaded it must weigh no more than 150 kilograms or 2/3 of the kerbside weight of the motorcycle - whichever is lighter.

When hitched, the distance between the end of the trailer and the rear axle of the motorcycle must be no more than 2.5 metres.
