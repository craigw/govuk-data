$!If you don't get a place on your chosen university course, you can apply for other courses through clearing$!

There's a good chance you'll find another course through clearing if:

- you're flexible about the course you study
- you have reasonable exam results

If you miss your grades by a narrow margin, you may still get a place on one of your chosen courses.

##Who can use clearing 

You can use clearing if:

- you’ve completed a [UCAS](http://www.ucas.com/ "UCAS"){:rel="external"} application
- you don’t get any offers
- your offers aren’t confirmed
- you want to turn down an offer

If you apply late for your course (after 30 June) you’ll automatically be entered into clearing.

##Find a course through clearing

Clearing runs from mid-July until September each year. You can find out which courses have vacancies through [UCAS](http://www.ucas.com/ "UCAS"){:rel="external"} from mid-August until late September. Not all universities or courses have vacancies, and some may be filled quickly. 

Once you've got your exam results, you can contact universities and colleges about getting a place. 

##Accepting an offer

You can only accept one offer. Once your place is confirmed, you have to accept it and can't look for another place.
