This can include mergers were 2 companies close and combine to form a new one. \r\n\r\nTo be protected under TUPE during a business transfer the identity of your employer must change.\r\n\r\n###Service provision changes\r\n\r\nThis is when:\r\n\r\n- a service provided by your employer (eg cleaning, workplace catering) is awarded to a contractor \r\n- a contract ends and is given to a new contractor\r\n- a contract ends and the work is transferred in-house by the former customer \r\n\r\nYou won't be protected under TUPE if the contract is:\r\n\r\n- for the supply of goods for the company's use (eg a restaurant changing food suppliers)\r\n- for a single event or short-term task (eg a catering company being used for a large corporate event)\r\n\r\nYou're only protected under a service provision change if you have been doing the work being transferred.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n\r\n**Example:**  \r\n\r\nYou're employed directly as a cleaner by a company that decides to use an outside cleaning company instead.
