For example, adjusting your working hours or providing you with a special piece of equipment to help you do the job.\r\n \r\n##Recruitment\r\n\r\nAn employer who's recruiting staff may make limited enquiries about your health or disability. \r\n\r\nYou can only be asked about your health or disability: \r\n\r\n* to help find out if you can take part in an interview\r\n* to help decide if the interviewers need to make reasonable adjustments for you in a selection process\r\n* to help decide if you can carry out a task that is an essential part of the work\r\n* to help monitoring\r\n* if they want to increase the number of disabled people they employ\r\n* if they need to know for the purposes of national security checks\r\n\r\nYou may be asked whether you have a health condition or disability on an application form or in an interview.

This includes:\r\n\r\n- 'direct discrimination' - eg refusing admission to a student because of disability \r\n- 'indirect discrimination' - eg only providing application forms in one format that may not be accessible\r\n- 'discrimination arising from a disability' - eg a disabled pupil is prevented from going outside at break time because it takes too long to get there\r\n- 'harassment' - eg a teacher shouts at a disabled student for not paying attention when the student's disability stops them from easily concentrating\r\n\r\n## Reasonable adjustments\r\n\r\nAn education provider has a duty to make 'reasonable adjustments' to make sure disabled students are not discriminated against.
