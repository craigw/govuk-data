$!Having to work on a Sunday depends on your employment contract - and there are special rules for shop workers and people who work in betting.$!

You should check either:

- your employment contract
- the written statement of terms and conditions 

If it doesn't mention Sunday working, you can't be made to work - unless both you and your employer agree and put it in writing - eg your contract's changed.

^If you work on a Sunday, there's no law saying you should get paid more.^

##If you're a shop worker or work in betting
There are special rules for shop and betting workers (including bookmakers at a sports venue). 

You can opt-out of Sunday working, even if your contract says you have to work. You should give your employer 3 months' written notice.

^Your employer isn't allowed to sack you or treat you unfairly if you opt-out - an [Employment Tribunal](employment-tribunals "Employment Tribunal") may award you compensation if they do.^

##If you've been working for the same shop or betting shop for many years

You will already be protected from having to work on Sundays, if you're a:

- shop worker and have been with the same employer since 25 August 1994 or earlier
- betting shop worker and been with the same employer since 2 January 1995 or earlier

If you want to work Sundays, you can opt-in by writing to your employer.
