$!You have the right to see CCTV footage of yourself and get a copy within 40 days of asking for it.$!

You need to make a request in writing to the owner of the closed circuit television (CCTV) system. The owner's details are usually written on a sign attached to the camera, unless the owner is obvious (like a shop).

You need to provide enough information so that you can be identified in the footage, like:

- a specific date and time
- proof of your identity
- a description of yourself

The CCTV owner decides how they provide the footage. You can be charged a fee of up to Â£10 (the current maximum set by law). 

The footage may be edited to protect the identities of other people.

##CCTV footage of a crime
