If you buy a property in the UK over a certain price, you have to pay Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT). This is charged on all purchases of houses, flats and other land and buildings.

Purchase price of residential property | Rate of SDLT (percentage of the total purchase price)  | Rate of SDLT for first-time buyers (percentage of the total purchase price)
 - | - | -
£0 - £125,000|  0% | 0%
£125,001 - £250,000 | 1% | 0%
£250,001 - £500,000 |  3% | 3%
£500,001 - £1 million | 4% | 4% 
£1 million or more |  5% |  5%

^ You're a first-time buyer if you haven't owned a house or flat in the UK or anywhere else in the world. If you're buying with someone else, they can't have owned property before either.

##Zero-carbon homes

Zero-carbon homes must meet certain requirements for generating energy for things like heating and cooking. 

All houses under £500,000 are exempt from SDLT. Houses bought for £500,000 or above will have their SDLT bill reduced by £15,000.

To qualify, a zero-carbon home must be given a certificate by an accredited assessor.
