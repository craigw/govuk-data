$!Your employment status affects your rights in the workplace as well as your tax and National Insurance.$!

There are 3 different types of employment status:

- workers
- employees
- self-employed

Your employment status will determine your rights at work.

##Workers

The main requirements for being a 'worker' are that you:

- have to do work or services personally and can't send someone else to complete, or sub-contract, the work
- are not doing the work as part of your own business (eg if the 'employer' is actually one of your clients)

As a worker you are entitled to core employment rights, including the right to:

- receive the [National Minimum Wage](/your-right-to-minimum-wage "Your right to the minimum wage")
- protection against unlawful deduction from wages
- a minimum period of paid [annual leave](/holiday-entitlement-your-rights "Holiday entitlement: your rights")
- minimum length of [rest breaks](/rest-breaks-at-work "Rest breaks at work")
- not work more than 48 hours on average per week or to opt out of this right if you choose
- protection against unlawful  [discrimination](discrimination-your-rights "Discrimination")
- protection for ['whistleblowing'](/whistleblowing "Whistleblowing") (reporting wrongdoing in the workplace)

You may also be entitled to:

- [Statutory Maternity Pay](/statutory-maternity-pay "Statutory Maternity Pay")
- [Ordinary Statutory Paternity Pay](/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay "Ordinary Statutory Paternity Pay")
- [Statutory Sick Pay](/statutory-sick-pay-ssp "Statutory Sick Pay")

##Employees

As an employee you have a wider range of employment rights and responsibilities. These rights include all of the rights workers have, and:

- [Statutory Sick Pay](/statutory-sick-pay-ssp "Statutory Sick Pay")
- minimum notice periods if your employment will be ending (eg if your employer is dismissing you)
- not be [unfairly dismissed](/dismissal/unfair-and-constructive-dismissal "Unfair dismissal")
- maternity, paternity and adoption leave and pay
- request [flexible working](/flexible-working "Flexible working")
- time off for emergencies
- [Statutory Redundancy Pay](/redundant-your-rights/statutory-redundancy-pay- "Statutory Redundancy Pay")

Some of these rights require a minimum length of continuous service with your employer before you qualify for them.

Employees have an [employment contract](/employment-contracts-and-conditions "Employment contracts and conditions"). This is normally a written contract but it could also be spoken, implied or a mix of all 3. 

##Self-employed

Employment legislation does not generally cover self-employed people because you are, in effect, your own boss.

You still have protection for your health and safety and, in some cases, protection against [discrimination](discrimination-your-rights "Discrimination").

Your rights and responsibilities would be set out by the terms of the contract you have with your client.

##Disputes about your employment status

You can get help to [solve a workplace dispute](/solve-workplace-dispute/overview "Solve a workplace dispute") but only a court or [Employment Tribunal](/employment-tribunals "Employment tribunals") can make a final decision on your employment status.
