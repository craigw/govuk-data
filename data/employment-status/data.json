These rights include all of the rights workers have, and:\r\n\r\n- [Statutory Sick Pay](/statutory-sick-pay-ssp \"Statutory Sick Pay\")\r\n- minimum notice periods if your employment will be ending (eg if your employer is dismissing you)\r\n- not be [unfairly dismissed](/dismissal/unfair-and-constructive-dismissal \"Unfair dismissal\")\r\n- maternity, paternity and adoption leave and pay\r\n- request [flexible working](/flexible-working \"Flexible working\")\r\n- time off for emergencies\r\n- [Statutory Redundancy Pay](/redundant-your-rights/statutory-redundancy-pay- \"Statutory Redundancy Pay\")\r\n\r\nSome of these rights require a minimum length of continuous service with your employer before you qualify for them.\r\n\r\nEmployees have an [employment contract](/employment-contracts-and-conditions \"Employment contracts and conditions\"). This is normally a written contract but it could also be spoken, implied or a mix of all 3. \r\n\r\n##Self-employed\r\n\r\nEmployment legislation does not generally cover self-employed people because you are, in effect, your own boss.\r\n\r\nYou still have protection for your health and safety and, in some cases, protection against [discrimination](discrimination-your-rights \"Discrimination\").\r\n\r\nYour rights and responsibilities would be set out by the terms of the contract you have with your client.\r\n\r\n##Disputes about your employment status\r\n\r\nYou can get help to [solve a workplace dispute](/solve-workplace-dispute/overview \"Solve a workplace dispute\") but only a court or [Employment Tribunal](/employment-tribunals \"Employment tribunals\") can make a final decision on your employment status.\r\n","overview":"Your employment status (worker, employee or self-employed) affects your rights in the workplace as well as tax and National Insurance","title":"Employment status","type":"answer"}
