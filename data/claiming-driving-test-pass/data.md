$!When you pass your driving test, DVLA needs to be told before you get your full licence - your examiner will usually do this for you.$!

If you’ve got a photocard driving licence issued after 1 March 2004 your practical test examiner will send your details to DVLA. You'll be sent your full licence within 4 weeks.

Otherwise you'll need to apply by post.

%You must exchange your test pass certificate within 2 years of passing your test or you’ll have to retake your test.%
