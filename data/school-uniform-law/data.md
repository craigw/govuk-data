$! Each school decides its uniform and must not discriminate based on gender, race, disability, sexual orientation or belief. $!

##Discipline

The head teacher can discipline your child for not wearing the school uniform. Your child can only be [suspended or expelled](school-discipline-exclusions "School discipline and exclusions") if they repeatedly ignore the uniform rules.

##Help with the cost of buying uniforms

If your child isn't wearing the uniform because you can't afford it, talk to the head teacher. The school should give you time to buy the right clothes. You can also get financial help from your local council.

##Discrimination
Schools can decide if girls can wear trousers, or if religious dress is allowed. If you think your child is being discriminated against, talk to the head teacher.

##Changes to the school uniform
If you'd like the school uniform changed, talk to the head teacher and school governors. If the school has a parent/teacher association, they may be able to help. If you're forced to buy uniforms from an expensive supplier, get advice from the [Office of Fair Trading.](http://www.oft.gov.uk/contactus "Contact the Office of Fair Trading"){:rel="external"}
