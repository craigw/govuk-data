$!You can use reasonable force to protect yourself or others if a crime is taking place inside your home.$!

This means you can:

- protect yourself 'in the heat of the moment' - this includes using an object as a weapon
- stop an intruder running off - eg tackle them to the ground

If you use reasonable force, you're unlikely to be prosecuted.

^You don't have to wait to be attacked before defending yourself in your home.^

However, you could be prosecuted - for example if you:

- carry on attacking the intruder even if you're no longer in danger
- pre-plan a trap for someone - rather than involve the police
