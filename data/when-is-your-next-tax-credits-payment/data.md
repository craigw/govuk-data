$!Your payments are made every week or every 4 weeks, depending on what you chose when you made your claim.$!

If you are not sure when your next payment is due, check the date of your first payment on your annual award notice. From that you can work out when your next payment will be, based on how often you are paid. 

You can also check your bank statement to see when your last payment was made. 

##Bank holidays
If your payment date is on a bank holiday, you will be paid a few days early. This is the case if there is a bank holiday anywhere in the UK.
