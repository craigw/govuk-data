$!You must use a qualified builder or scaffolding hire company to put up scaffolding.$!

Itâ€™s the responsibility of the builder or scaffolding company to get a licence for any scaffolding they put up on the highway (this includes the pavement). 

But it's your responsibility to check they have this legal document and that it does not run out before the building work is finished.

^Your [local council](http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/Start.do?mode=1 "Find your local council"){:rel="external"} may have a list of approved scaffolding hire companies.^

##Safety

Be aware that:

+ if there is a risk to the public, schedule scaffolding work for quiet times or get a highway closure from your local council

+ scaffolding structures must be checked regularly, and inspected after alterations, damage or extreme weather conditions
