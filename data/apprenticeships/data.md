$!Apprenticeships combine practical training on the job and studying towards a qualification.$!

##How do apprenticeships work?

Companies hire apprentices as employees and get them trained up by qualified professionals. Usually for 1 day a week, apprentices go to school to study towards a qualification.

Anyone in England over 16 and not in full-time education can apply for an apprenticeship.

Apprenticeships generally take between 2 and 4 years.
