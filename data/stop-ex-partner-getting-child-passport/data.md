You can [apply for a court order](http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=2253 "Form C100 - Apply for a court order about your child"){:rel="external"} that prevents your child getting a passport without your (or the court's) consent.

You can then show this court order to the Identity and Passport Service (IPS). They won't issue a passport for your child if your ex-partner (or another relative) applies.

##If you're the child's mother

You may not need a court order if you're the childâ€™s mother and:

- you've not been married to the child's father
- the father hasn't been given [parental responsibility](/parental-rights-responsibilities "parental responsibility")

You still need to contact the IPS to ask them not to issue a passport for your child.

@ If your child has already been taken abroad, call the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on 020 7008 0878 @
