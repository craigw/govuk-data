##Are you homeless?

You're legally homeless if the place you live is unsafe, unsuitable or you have no legal right to be there. You can be legally homeless if you're staying with friends or another family for a while. You don't have to be sleeping rough to be homeless.

##Under 16

If you’re under 16, you can’t legally make the decision to leave home. An adult must have responsibility for you.

If you're having serious problems at home, contact the council. They'll try and help you sort things out so you can stay at home. If living at home is too dangerous or impossible, they can:

- arrange for you to live with another family member or adult, like a friend’s parent
- find you emergency accommodation

They can also look at other options including going into care or living with a [foster family](/foster-carers "Foster carers").

##16 or 17

^ If you're under 18, you can't legally sign a tenancy contract or mortgage agreement. ^

You'll be on the 'priority need' for [council housing](/council-housing "Council housing") if you're 16 or 17 and you can't live at home.

The exceptions are if you:

- aren't a British citizen
- have spent at least 13 weeks in care since the age of 14
- are classed as a ‘child in need’

If any of these apply to you, social services will see if there’s any way you can return home, or go and live with another relative. They can't force you to go back somewhere you don't feel safe.

###What a 'child in need' is

You're a 'child in need' if:

- you're living with a violent person
- you don't have money for food
- you don't have anywhere to live
- you have problems that affect your health or education (eg you're disabled)
- your home is uninhabitable (eg there's been a fire or flood)
