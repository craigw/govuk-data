$!If you work in a organisation with more than 250 people, you have the legal right to ask for time off work for training or study. $!

The training has to lead to a qualification or be relevant to your job. Your employer might pay for it but they don't have to.

##Who can make a request
You have to be an employee and with your employer for at least 26 weeks.

##Check with your employer
If your employer already has a scheme to make training requests, follow that process.

##Making a request
If your employer doesn't have a formal process you can write to them saying that it is a request under 'Section 63D of the Employment Rights Act 1996'  as well as details of the training.

Your employer has to consider your request within 28 days. They will only be able to turn it down if they have a good business reason.
