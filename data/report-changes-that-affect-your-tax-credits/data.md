$!You need to tell the Tax Credit Office of any changes to your circumstances that could affect your tax credits payments.$!

You can report a change by calling the [Tax Credit Helpline](/contact-the-tax-credit-office "Contact the Tax Credit Office"). 

##What kind of changes you need to report
Your payments could be affected if there are changes to your:

- place of residence
- income
- relationships - such as getting married or separating from a partner
- personal details - such as bank accounts or contact details
- childcare costs or provider
- family - for example if you have a baby or adopt or foster a child

##Why you need to report changes
If you don't report a change, you could:

- be overpaid from the date of the change - you may have to pay the money back
- have to pay a penalty of up to Â£300
- lose out if the change meant you were entitled to more money - increases can usually only be backdated by up to 3 months from the time you report the change
