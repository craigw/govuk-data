$!If you can't get to work because of travel disruption, a strike or severe weather, your employer may be able to say you must take leave if they give you enough notice.$!

^Your rights may also depend on your employment contract so check this, your staff handbook or intranet site to see what they are.^

##Taking paid leave##
If there’s travel disruption, your employer can only tell when to take statutory paid holiday if they give you the correct notice. Statutory leave is the holiday you’re legally entitled to. Your employer must give you notice that is double the length of time they want you to take in leave. 
 
If you get additional holiday above the legal minimum ('contractual holiday entitlement'), your employer doesn't have to give you any notice.

##Taking unpaid holiday##
Your employer may ask you to take a day's unpaid leave because of travel disruption. If you agree, you'll have a day's pay deducted from your wages. Your company can only make you take a day's unpaid holiday if your contract says you have to. 

##Working flexibly##
If you work flexibly, your employer may ask you to work from home or make up time later. Unless your employment contract says you have to, your employer can't make you do this.

##If your office is closed##
If your office is closed because of disruption and you don't work from home, your employer can't deduct pay or make you take a day's leave.
