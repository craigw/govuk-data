##Find out if you live in a smoke control area

[Contact your local council](http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?mode=1.1 "contact your local council"){:rel="external"} to see if you live in a smoke control area. The environmental services department will be able to help you. 

##What you can burn in smoke control areas

In a smoke control area you can only burn:

- anthracite
- semi-anthracite
- gas
- low volatile steam coals
- [authorised fuels](http://smokecontrol.defra.gov.uk/fuels.php "authorised fuels"){:rel="external"} 

###Oil and kindling

You can use oil or other liquid fuels in specially designed fireplaces. Kindling can sometimes also be used - but [ask your council](http://local.direct.gov.uk/LDGRedirect/index.jsp?mode=1.1 "ask your council"){:rel="external"} first as there are different rules in different areas.

###Barbecues and chimineas

You're allowed barbecues and chimineas, but if your barbecue lets smoke out through a chimney of a building - like a summerhouse - it's only allowed if it uses gas or electricity.

##Exempt appliances that can burn banned fuels

Some boilers, cookers and stoves are allowed to burn banned fuels, which include:

- wood
- coal
- wood chips and pellets

There's a [list of exempt appliances](http://smokecontrol.defra.gov.uk/appliances.php "list of exempt appliances"){:rel="external"} on the Defra website.

^You're allowed garden bonfires in smoke control areas but you need to follow the [rules on bonfires](/garden-bonfires-rules "rules on bonfires").^
