$!Students in higher education can apply for money directly from their university or college on top of any other student finance - you don’t have to pay this money back.$!

##Bursaries, scholarships and awards

Each university or college has their own rules about bursaries, scholarships and awards. For example: 

- how much you can get  
- who qualifies  
- how to apply  

Bursaries are like grants and don’t have to be paid back. You get your bursary directly from your school, college or training provider. 

^Talk to your student support service to find out what’s available.^

##On a low income

You can apply for a bursary from the National Scholarship Programme if your household income is less than £25,000 a year. This can be a cash bursary of up to £1,000 or help with tuition fees and accommodation.

If you're awarded a cash bursary it's paid directly into your bank account by your university or college.

##Leaving local authority care

If you’ve been in local authority care, you can apply for: 

- a one-off bursary of £2,000 from your local authority  
- a bursary from your university or college
