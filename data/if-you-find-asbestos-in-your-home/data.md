$!If asbestos is damaged or disturbed, get professional advice before you repair or remove it – otherwise, it's safe to leave in place.$!

If you have damaged or disturbed asbestos in your home:

* never sand, drill or saw it
* where possible, repair and then protect it, as long as the repair or seal will last and won't be disturbed
* only remove asbestos if repair isn't possible or it's likely to be disturbed

##Disposing of asbestos
