[Registering](register-for-the-first-time \"Register for the first time\") your property:\r\n\r\n+ provides an up-to-date official record of who owns the land\r\n+ gives you greater security\r\n+ means you might be able to get compensation from Land Registry if you suffer a financial loss because of fraud\r\n\r\n##Keep your details up-to-date\r\nIf you have property registered with Land Registry, you have to provide an 'address for service'. Land Registry will use this to contact you.\r\n\r\nUpdating your contact details is free and helps make sure you get important communications. To do this, download ['Keep your contact details up-to-date' (PDF, 394KB)](http://www1.landregistry.gov.uk/upload/documents/updating_contact_form.pdf \"Keep your contact details up-to-date: Land Registry\"){:rel=\"external\"} from Land Registry.\r\n\r\nYou can have up to 3 addresses. For example:\r\n\r\n+ an address where you\u2019re living now\r\n+ an email address\r\n+ an address abroad\r\n\r\n^If you register more than 1 address, you're more likely to find out if Land Registry receives a fraudulent application about your property.^\r\n\r\n##Have a 'care of' address\r\nYou can ask your legal adviser if they\u2019ll act as a 'care of\u2019 address. This means any letters Land Registry sends to you will also be sent to them.\r\n\r\n##Put a restriction on your title\r\nA restriction limits the powers of the registered owner to deal with or dispose of a property (eg sell it or use it to raise a mortgage). This could help stop someone forging your signature on a deed to try to defraud you.\r\n\r\n$E\r\n**Example:** If you have an \u2018LL\u2019 restriction on your title, somebody can only register the sale or mortgage of the property if a professional conveyancer certifies that they're the owner.\r\n$E\r\n\r\nSpeak to your legal adviser about putting a restriction on the title.\r\n\r\n## When you're most at risk from property fraud\r\nYou're more likely to be at risk if:\r\n\r\n- your property\u2019s mortgage has been paid off\r\n- your property is empty or you're letting it\r\n- you're abroad, absent, infirm or in a home\r\n\r\n^If you're worried you may already be the victim of property fraud, [contact Land Registry](http://www.landreg.gov.uk/about-us/office-finder \"Find your nearest Land Registry office\"){:rel=\"external\"} immediately.
