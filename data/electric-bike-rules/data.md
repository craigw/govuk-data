$!In Great Britain, if you're 14 or over you don't need a licence to ride electric bikes that meet certain requirements, and they don't need to be registered, taxed or insured.$!

Electric bikes meeting the requirements are called ‘electrically assisted pedal cycles’ (EAPCs). They can be two-wheeled bicycles, tandems or tricycles.

##EAPC requirements

- the bike must have pedals that can be used to propel it
- the electric motor shouldn't be able to propel the bike when it’s travelling more than 15mph
- the bike (including its battery but not the rider) must not be heavier than 40kg if it’s a bicycle, or 60kg if it’s a tandem or tricycle
- the motor shouldn’t have a maximum power output of more than 200 watts if it’s a bicycle and 250 watts if it’s a tandem or tricycle
- the bike must have a plate showing the manufacturer, the nominal voltage of the battery, and the motor’s power output

##Other kinds of electric bike

Any electric bike that doesn’t meet the EAPC rules needs to be registered and taxed. You’ll need a driving licence to ride one and you must wear a crash helmet.

The vehicle will also need to be ‘type approved’ to make sure it’s safe to use on the road.
