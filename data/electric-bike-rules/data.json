They can be two-wheeled bicycles, tandems or tricycles.\r\n\r\n##EAPC requirements\r\n\r\n- the bike must have pedals that can be used to propel it\r\n- the electric motor shouldn't be able to propel the bike when it\u2019s travelling more than 15mph\r\n- the bike (including its battery but not the rider) must not be heavier than 40kg if it\u2019s a bicycle, or 60kg if it\u2019s a tandem or tricycle\r\n- the motor shouldn\u2019t have a maximum power output of more than 200 watts if it\u2019s a bicycle and 250 watts if it\u2019s a tandem or tricycle\r\n- the bike must have a plate showing the manufacturer, the nominal voltage of the battery, and the motor\u2019s power output\r\n\r\n##Other kinds of electric bike\r\n\r\nAny electric bike that doesn\u2019t meet the EAPC rules needs to be registered and taxed. You\u2019ll need a driving licence to ride one and you must wear a crash helmet.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle will also need to be \u2018type approved\u2019 to make sure it\u2019s safe to use on the road.
