The court decides if the child can be taken into care.\r\n\r\nWhen a child is in care, the local authority is responsible for:\r\n\r\n- looking after the child\r\n- giving them somewhere to live\r\n- their education\r\n\r\nThe child may be placed with:\r\n\r\n- another relative\r\n- a foster parent\r\n- a children's home\r\n\r\nA child can be taken into care if they are under 17 years of age (or under 16 if they are married).\r\n\r\nCare orders last until the child's 19th birthday, until they are adopted, or until the court lifts the order (this is called 'discharging' the order).\r\n\r\n##Support for parents\r\n\r\nThe Family Rights Group Advice Service helpline provides confidential support for parents:\r\n\r\n$C **Family Rights Group helpline**  \r\n0800 731 1696  \r\nMonday to Friday  \r\n10am to 3.30pm $C\r\n","slug":"overview","title":"Overview"}},{"table":{"body":"If the local authority is very worried about a child, it can start \u2018care proceedings\u2019. \r\n\r\nIf it believes that the child should be adopted, it can apply for a \u2018placement order\u2019 as well. \r\n\r\n##What are care proceedings?\r\n\r\n###1. Interim care order\r\nThe local authority asks the family court to make a temporary court order, called an \u2018interim care order\u2019. If the court agrees, the local authority can take the child into care on a temporary basis. This can be for up to 8 weeks at first. After that, it can be renewed every 28 days.\r\n\r\n###2. Looking at the case\r\nIt can take up to a year for a court to decide what should happen to the child. Sometimes it can take even longer than this. \r\n\r\nDuring that time a social worker, a [Cafcass](cafcass \"Cafcass\") officer, and other people will be trying to understand the reasons why the child may be at risk. They will also look at what can be done to keep them safe. \r\n\r\nThey will talk to the parents and the child. They may talk to other family members or friends about looking after the child if they can't safely live at home. The parents might also get support.\r\n\r\n###3. Reports\r\nThe social worker and Cafcass officer will each write a report for the court. These will outline what they think should happen to the child. They will include whether they think the child should be taken into care or stay with the family. \r\n\r\nOnce all the information has been gathered, there will be a court hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n*[Cafcass]: Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service","slug":"when-a-child-is-taken-into-care","title":"When a child is taken into care"}},{"table":{"body":"Once all the information has been gathered, there will be a court hearing.

They may also recommend to the court that other independent professionals help the court with advice, eg a doctor or a psychologist.\r\n\r\n*[Cafcass]: Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service","slug":"cafcass","title":"Cafcass"}}],"type":"guide"}
