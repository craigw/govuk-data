$!There are no laws against having a bonfire, but there are laws for the nuisance they can cause.$!

##Burning domestic waste
You **can’t** get rid of house waste if it will cause pollution or harm people’s health. This includes burning it. 

You can get rid of house waste by composting or recycling it. Contact your local council to find out how to [dispose of garden waste](/garden-waste-disposal "Dispose of garden waste") and about [recycling in your area](recycling-collections "Recycling collections").

##Danger to traffic by smoke
If you light a fire and you allow the smoke to drift across the road, you could be fined if it is a danger to traffic.

##Complain about a neighbour's bonfire

If a neighbour's bonfire is causing a nuisance, your council can issue an ‘abatement notice’. To be considered a nuisance, a bonfire must happen regularly.

If your neighbour doesn’t stick to the notice, they can be fined:

+ up to £5,000
+ another £500 for each day they ignore the notice
