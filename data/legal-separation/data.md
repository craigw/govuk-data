$!To get a legal separation, you need to fill in a separation petition and send it to the court.$!

A legal separation allows you to live apart, without divorcing or ending a civil partnership.

You can ask for a legal separation for the same reasons you could file for a divorce, eg:

- adultery
- unreasonable behaviour

However, you don't need to show that the marriage has broken down irretrievably.

You may want a legal separation if:

- you have religious reasons against divorce
- you've been married less than a year
- you want time and space to work out if you want to end the marriage

Fill in a [judicial separation petition - form D8.](http://hmctsformfinder.direct.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=1115 "judicial separation petition - form D8"){:rel="external"}

Send 2 copies of the petition to the court, and keep your own copy. You need to include a certified copy of your marriage or civil partnership certificate when you send the form.

Getting a legal separation costs £340.

^You may be able to get help with [court fees](/court-fees-what-they-are/ "court fees") if you’re on benefits or a low income.
