$!It’s illegal to drive if you're unfit to do so because you’re on legal or illegal drugs.$!

If the police stop you and think you’re on drugs they can do a ‘Field Impairment Assessment’. This is a series of tests, like asking you to walk in a straight line and checking the size of your pupils.

If they think you’re unfit to drive because of taking drugs, you’ll be arrested and will have a blood test at a police station. If the test shows you’ve taken drugs you could be charged with a crime.

^You don't have to be on illegal drugs to be unfit to drive - many prescription or over-the-counter drugs can also impair your ability to drive. If you're on legal drugs and not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or healthcare professional before driving.^
