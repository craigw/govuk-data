You might have extra rights if you have a warranty.\r\n\r\nIf you buy from a private seller (eg online auction, newspaper advert) you have fewer rights - the item just has to be:\r\n\r\n- theirs to sell\r\n- as described\r\n\r\n^You also have rights if you buy a service (like building work) or sign up to a contract (like a gym).^\r\n\r\n##Returning faulty goods\r\n\r\nTell the trader as soon as possible - either by returning the item to the shop or contacting the trader. You'll need proof of purchase, like:\r\n\r\n- a receipt\r\n- an invoice\r\n- a credit card bill or bank statement\r\n- the shop's packaging\r\n\r\n###Proving goods are faulty\r\n\r\nIf you're asking for a refund, the trader might ask you to prove that the goods were faulty when you bought them. \r\n\r\nIf you're asking for a repair or replacement:\r\n\r\n- if you bought the item in the last 6 months, it's the trader's responsibility to prove it wasn't faulty when you bought it \r\n\r\n- if you bought it over 6 months ago, you have to prove the fault wasn't caused by accidental damage or wear and tear\r\n\r\n^If there's nothing wrong with an item you buy in a shop, you don't have the legal right to return it, but some shops may let you - check their returns policy.^\r\n\r\n##How you pay and your rights\r\n\r\nIf you pay for something using a credit agreement, credit card or Visa or Maestro debit card, you have extra rights if:\r\n\r\n- there\u2019s a fault with the item or service\r\n- the trader's gone out of business\r\n\r\nIf you paid for something costing between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000 using a credit card or credit agreement, you can make a claim from your finance company.\r\n\r\nYou can claim your money back through a debit card 'chargeback' scheme if you paid using: \r\n\r\n- Visa\r\n- Mastercard \r\n- Maestro\r\n\r\nThis applies to any amount. Contact the bank that provides your card to make a claim.\r\n\r\n##Your right to change your mind\r\n\r\nYou usually have 7 working days to cancel your order and ask for your money back if you buy something:\r\n\r\n- online\r\n- over the phone\r\n- by mail order (eg from a catalogue)\r\n- on your doorstep (eg when a salesman visits your home)\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t have this right if your item is:\r\n\r\n- personalised or made to order\r\n- perishable, eg food or flowers\r\n- a newspaper or magazine\r\n- a financial product (eg a loan)\r\n- a CD, DVD or computer software where the security seal has been broken","slug":"overview","title":"Overview"}},{"table":{"body":"The law gives you rights when you buy things without face-to-face contact.

You also have extra rights - the law says that:\r\n\r\n- you must be given clear information about what you're buying before you buy\r\n- you must get written confirmation of this information after you've made your purchase\r\n- there's a 'cooling-off period' where you can cancel your order for any reason\r\n- you can get a refund if items aren't delivered on the agreed delivery date\r\n\r\n^If no delivery date is given, you can get a refund if your items aren't delivered within 30 days of your order.^\r\n\r\n##Your right to cancel\r\n\r\nThere's a cooling-off period of 7 working days where you can cancel your order for any reason and get your money back.\r\n\r\nYou don't have this right:\r\n\r\n- when a new service starts immediately (eg paying to use a website)\r\n- if the item is personalised or made to order\r\n- if the item is perishable, eg food or flowers\r\n- for newspapers or magazines\r\n- where the security seal has been broken on a CD, DVD or computer software\r\n- if you buy something from an online auction on a site like eBay \r\n\r\n^If you've already paid for the item or service, the seller must refund your money within 30 days of you cancelling the agreement.^\r\n\r\nThe cooling-off period starts the day after you receive the goods. The seller has to tell you in writing:\r\n\r\n- your right to a cooling-off period\r\n- how to cancel your order\r\n- who's responsible for returning goods\r\n- who has to pay the cost of returning goods if you cancel in the cooling-off period\r\n- about any after-sales service\r\n- how to complain\r\n\r\nIf you don't get this information, your cooling-off period extends to a maximum of 3 months and 7 working days. So if a trader takes a month to tell you in writing, you get a cooling-off period of 1 month and 7 days.\r\n\r\n##If you've been sent the wrong item or if it's faulty\r\n\r\nIf this happens you can return it and ask for your money back - the seller has to pay postage.\r\n\r\n^If the seller is based overseas, check the website or contract to see which country's law applies if things go wrong.^\r\n\r\n##How to complain\r\n\r\nTalk to the seller first. If you've paid using a credit card you can also complain to the finance company. \r\n\r\nYou can get your money back via a debit card 'chargeback' scheme if you paid using:\r\n\r\n- Visa\r\n- Mastercard \r\n- Maestro\r\n\r\nThis protects you if there's a problem with the goods or if the seller has stopped trading.
