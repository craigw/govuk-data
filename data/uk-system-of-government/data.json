He or she has a number of responsibilities including:\r\n\r\n- overseeing the Civil Service\r\n- appointing members of the Cabinet\r\n- keeping the Queen informed about the work of government\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister is based at Number 10 Downing Street in London. There's more information on the [Number 10 website.](http://www.number10.gov.uk/ \"Number 10 website\"){:rel=\"external\"}\r\n\r\n##The Cabinet\r\n\r\nThis is the committee at the centre of the British political system. Cabinet ministers are appointed by the Prime Minister. \r\n\r\nMost of them are heads of government departments with the title 'Secretary of State'. Some have other titles, like the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet meets every Tuesday to discuss the issues of the day. The Prime Minister chairs the meeting and sets the agenda. \r\n\r\nThere are also [Cabinet committees](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/cabinet-and-its-committees \"Cabinet committees\"){:rel=\"external\"} that meet in smaller groups with other government ministers. \r\n\r\nYou can [find out more about the Cabinet](http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/cabinet/ \"find out more about the Cabinet\"){:rel=\"external\"} on the Number 10 website.\r\n\r\n##Parliament\r\n\r\nParliament is based in Westminster in London. It is made up of the House of Commons and the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nIts role is to:\r\n\r\n- look at what the government is doing\r\n- debate and pass new laws\r\n- set taxes\r\n- debate issues\r\n\r\nThere are 650 elected MPs in the House of Commons. \r\n\r\n^You can [find out more about how Parliament works](http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/ \"find out more about how Parliament works\"){:rel=\"external\"} on the Parliament website.^\r\n\r\n*[MPs]: Members of Parliament\r\n*[MP]: Member of Parliament","slug":"overview","title":"Overview"}},{"table":{"body":"Laws go through several stages before they are passed by Parliament. The House of Lords and the House of Commons work together to make them.\r\n\r\n##White and green papers\r\n\r\nWhite papers outline proposals for new laws. Before a white paper is published, there might be a green paper, which asks for comments from the public.  \r\n\r\n^There's no requirement that a white paper or green paper has to be produced.^\r\n\r\n##Bills\r\n\r\nThese are proposals for new laws or changes to existing ones. They get debated by Parliament and when they have been agreed, they have to be approved by the Queen before becoming law. This is called 'Royal Assent'.\r\n\r\n###Public bills\r\n\r\nThese are the most common type of bill. They change the law that applies to the general public. Most public bills are proposed by government ministers. \r\n\r\nIf you object to a public bill you can:\r\n\r\n- write to your MP or a Lord\r\n- contact the government department responsible for the bill\r\n- lobby Parliament\r\n\r\n\r\n##How bills become law\r\n\r\nA bill passes through several stages in the House of Commons and the House of Lords to become law:\r\n\r\n- first reading (this is where the bill is introduced without debate)\r\n- second reading (general debate)\r\n- committee stage (the bill is examined in detail - in the House of Commons this often takes place in a Public Bill Committee)\r\n- report stage (opportunity for further amendments)\r\n- third reading (the House of Lords can make amendments at this stage)\r\n\r\n##Acts of Parliament\r\n\r\nAn act is a bill that has been approved by the House of Lords, the House of Commons and the Queen. It can come into force:\r\n\r\n- immediately\r\n- at a future date\r\n- in stages\r\n\r\nThe relevant government department is responsible for putting the act into practice. \r\n\r\n","slug":"how-laws-are-made","title":"How laws are made"}},{"table":{"body":"Government departments and their agencies put government policy into practice. They also advise government ministers.\r\n\r\nDepartments and agencies are staffed by politically impartial civil servants and funded by Parliament. \r\n\r\n##Government departments\r\n\r\nSome departments, like the Ministry of Defence, cover the UK as a whole. Other departments don't - for example, the Department for Work and Pensions covers England, Wales and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland. \r\n\r\nMost departments are headed by ministers - there's a [list of government ministers and departments](http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/government-and-opposition1/her-majestys-government/ \"list of government ministers and departments\"){:rel=\"external\"} on the Parliament website.\r\n\r\n##Executive agencies\r\n\r\nThese are part of government departments and deliver government services. They don't set policy - this is done by the department that oversees the agency.\r\n\r\nFor example, Jobcentre Plus is an executive agency and part of the Department for Work and Pensions.\r\n\r\n##Non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs)\r\n\r\nThese work independently of ministers but are accountable to them. There are 2 main types of NDPB. \r\n\r\n###Executive NDPBs\r\n\r\nThese do work for the government in specific areas. They have varying degrees of independence. Examples include:\r\n\r\n- Arts Council England\r\n- the Environment Agency\r\n- the Health and Safety Executive\r\n\r\n###Advisory NDPBs\r\n\r\nThese are set up by ministers to advise on particular matters.

The rest are divided between:\r\n\r\n- central administrative and policy duties\r\n- support services\r\n- services that support themselves financially, like the Royal Mint\r\n\r\n^About 80% of civil servants work outside London.^\r\n\r\n###Recruitment\r\n\r\nThe Civil Service Commissioners make sure that recruitment to the Civil Service is based on fair and open competition.
