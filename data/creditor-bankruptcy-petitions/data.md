##Fees 
The court fees to make someone bankrupt are: 

+ £700 petition deposit (for managing the bankruptcy) 
+ £220 for court costs

You can pay the fees using cash, postal orders or a cheque made payable to Her Majesty’s Courts & Tribunal Service. 

##The basics  
You’ll need a solicitor or debt specialist to help you because you'll have to: 

+ petition (apply to) the court to issue a bankruptcy order 
+ prove the debtor owes more than £750 (to one or more creditors) 
+ prove the debtor can’t repay what they owe
