$!If you're a shift or casual worker or work annualised or compressed hours, your holiday entitlement may be calculated in shifts or hours. $!

##Shift workers##
Your employer may calculate your holiday entitlement as shifts. For example if you work 4, 12 hour shifts followed by 4 days off, then your average working week is calculated by:

- [number of shifts worked (4) ÷ total number of days in shift pattern(8)] x 7 days = 3.5, 12 hour shifts per week

Your statutory holiday entitlement is calculated by:

- 3.5 shifts per week x 5.6 (statutory leave entitlement) = 19.6, 12 hours shifts holiday

##Working annualised hours##
Your employer needs to calculate how many hours on average you work over the year. 

For example if you work 1600 hours a year, your average working week will be 34.48 hours. This is calculated by excluding statutory leave entitlement: 

s1. 52 weeks -  5.6 weeks (statutory leave entitlement) = 46.4 weeks of working
s2. 1600 ÷ 46.4 = 34.48 hours a week

Your holiday entitlement is calculated by:

- 5.6 weeks (statutory leave entitlement) x 34.48 hours a week = 193.09 hours paid holiday for the year.

##Working compressed hours##
For example if you work 36 hours over 4 days, you would be entitled to:

- 36 hours x 5.6 weeks (statutory leave entitlement) = 201.6 hours paid holiday for the year.

You would take the number of hours holiday that you would normally have worked - eg if you work 36 hours over four days, you would take 9 hours (36 ÷ 4) for each day of holiday.

##Casual or irregular hours##
Your employer will calculate your holidays as your entitlement builds up ('accrues') for each hour you work. This is done by converting 5.6 weeks of statutory holiday entitlement into a percentage of hours worked over the year (time worked over the year should exclude your statutory leave entitlement):

s1. 52 weeks -  5.6 weeks (statutory leave entitlement) = 46.4 weeks of working
s2. 5.6 ÷ 46.4 x 100 = 12.07 per cent

If you worked for 10 hours you would be entitled to 72.6 minutes paid holiday:

s1. (12.07÷100) x 10 hours work = 1.21 hours
s2. 1.21 hours = 60 minutes + (.21 x 60 mins) = 72.6 minutes
