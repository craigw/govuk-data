- details of their friends or relatives
- details of places the person often visits
- whether they had a medical condition
- for a sample of their DNA – eg from a toothbrush

With a relative's permission, they may also ask to search the person’s home.

##Knowing when someone is found

If the police find a person aged under 18, their parent(s) or guardian must be told their whereabouts.

If the person is aged over 18, they may not want to get in contact. The police won't pass on their whereabouts without their permission - but the police will let relatives know they're safe.
