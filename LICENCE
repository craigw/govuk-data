The gov.uk site says "Much of the information on this website is available for reuse under the Open Government Licence."

The Open Government Licence can be read here:

It's not clear from the website what data is or is not available under this licence. Caveat Emptor.

As for my code, it's available under the terms of the MIT licence, a copy of which is included in the file MIT-LICENCE.
